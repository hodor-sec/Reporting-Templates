During this phase, the tester should verify that it is  not possible for a user to modify his or her privileges or roles inside  the application in ways that could allow privilege escalation attacks. <br />Privilege escalation occurs when a user gets access to more  resources or functionality than they are normally allowed, and such  elevation or changes should have been prevented by the application. This  is usually caused by a flaw in the application. The result is that the  application performs actions with more privileges than those intended by  the developer or system administrator. <br /><br /> The degree of escalation depends on what privileges the attacker is  authorized to possess, and what privileges can be obtained in a  successful exploit. For example, a programming error that allows a user  to gain extra privilege after successful authentication limits the  degree of escalation, because the user is already authorized to hold  some privilege. Likewise, a remote attacker gaining superuser privilege  without any authentication presents a greater degree of escalation. <br /><br /> Usually, people refer to <em>vertical escalation</em> when it is possible  to access resources granted to more privileged accounts (e.g., acquiring  administrative privileges for the application), and to <em>horizontal escalation</em>  when it is possible to access resources granted to a similarly  configured account (e.g., in an online banking application, accessing  information related to a different user). <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to test</h2><br /><strong>Testing for role/privilege manipulation</strong> <br /> In every portion of the application where a user can create information  in the database (e.g., making a payment, adding a contact, or sending a  message), can receive information (statement of account, order details,  etc.), or delete information (drop users, messages, etc.), it is  necessary to record that functionality. The tester should try to access  such functions as another user in order to verify if it is possible to  access a function that should not be permitted by the user's  role/privilege (but might be permitted as another user). <br /><br /><h3>Manipulation of user group</h3><br />For example:<br /> The following HTTP POST allows the user that belongs to grp001 to access order #0001: <br /> POST /user/viewOrder.jsp HTTP/1.1<br /> Host: www.example.com<br /> ...<br /><br /> groupID=grp001&amp;orderID=0001<br />Verify if a user that does not belong to grp001 can modify the value  of the parameters ‘groupID’ and ‘orderID’ to gain access to that  privileged data. <br /><br /><h3>Manipulation of user profile</h3><br />For example:<br /> The following server's answer shows a hidden field in the HTML returned to the user after a successful authentication. <br />HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br />Server: Netscape-Enterprise/6.0<br />Date: Wed, 1 Apr 2006 13:51:20 GMT<br />Set-Cookie: USER=aW78ryrGrTWs4MnOd32Fs51yDqp; path=/; domain=www.example.com <br />Set-Cookie: SESSION=k+KmKeHXTgDi1J5fT7Zz; path=/; domain= www.example.com<br />Cache-Control: no-cache<br />Pragma: No-cache <br />Content-length: 247<br />Content-Type: text/html<br />Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT<br />Connection: close<br /><br />&lt;form  name="autoriz" method="POST" action = "visual.jsp"&gt; <br />&lt;input type="hidden" name="profile" value="SysAdmin"&gt;<br />&lt;body onload="document.forms.autoriz.submit()"&gt;<br />&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;/tr&gt;<br /><br /> What if the tester modifies the value of the variable "profile" to "SysAdmin"? Is it possible to become administrator? <br /><br /><h3>Manipulation of condition value</h3><br />For example:<br /> In an environment where the server sends an error message contained as a  value in a specific parameter in a set of answer codes, as the  following: <br />@0`1`3`3``0`UC`1`Status`OK`SEC`5`1`0`ResultSet`0`PVValid`-1`0`0` Notifications`0`0`3`Command  Manager`0`0`0` StateToolsBar`0`0`0`    <br />StateExecToolBar`0`0`0`FlagsToolBar`0<br /><br /> The server gives an implicit trust to the user. It believes that the  user will answer with the above message closing the session. <br />In this condition, verify that it is not possible to escalate  privileges by modifying the parameter values. In this particular  example, by modifying the `PVValid` value from '-1' to '0' (no error  conditions), it may be possible to authenticate as administrator to the  server. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Manipulation of IP Address</h3><br />Some webistes uses IP address to limit the access or count the number of error login based on IP address. <br />For example: <br />X-Forwarded-For: 8.1.1.1<br />In this case, if the website uses the value of 'X-forwarded-For' as  client IP address, tester may change the IP value of the  'X-forwarded-For' HTTP header to workaround the IP source  identification. <br /><br /><h3>URL Traversal</h3><br />Try to traverse the website and check if some of pages that may miss the authorization check. <br />For example: <br />/../.././userInfo.html<br /><br /><h3>WhiteBox</h3><br />If the URL authorization check is only done by partial URL match,  then it's likely testers or hackers may workaround the authorization by  URL encoding techniques.  <br />For example:  <br />startswith(), endswith(), contains(), indexOf()<br /><br /><h3>Weak SessionID</h3><br />Weak Session ID has algorithm may be vulnerable to brute Force attack.  For example, one website is using MD5 (Password + UserID) as sessionID.   Then, testers may guess or generate the sessionID for other users. <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>Whitepapers</strong><br /> <br />•  Wikipedia - Privilege Escalation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation</a><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />•  OWASP WebScarab: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project">OWASP WebScarab Project</a><br />•  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a><br /></div></body></html>
