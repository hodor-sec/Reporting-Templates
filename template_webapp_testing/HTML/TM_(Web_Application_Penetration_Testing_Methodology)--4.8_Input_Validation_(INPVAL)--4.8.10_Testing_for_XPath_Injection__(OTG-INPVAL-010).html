In XPath injection testing, we test  if it is possible to inject XPath syntax into a request interpreted by  the application, allowing an attacker to execute user-controlled XPath  queries. When successfully exploited, this vulnerability may allow an  attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms or access information  without proper authorization. <br /><br /> Web applications heavily use databases to store and access the data they  need for their operations. Historically, relational databases have been  by far the most common technology for data storage, but, in the last  years, we are witnessing an increasing popularity for databases that  organize data using the XML language. Just like relational databases are  accessed via SQL language, XML databases use XPath as their standard  query language.  <br /><br /> Since, from a conceptual point of view, XPath is very similar to SQL in  its purpose and applications, an interesting result is that XPath  injection attacks follow the same logic as <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a>  attacks. In some aspects, XPath is even more powerful than standard  SQL, as its whole power is already present in its specifications,  whereas a large number of the techniques that can be used in a SQL  Injection attack depend on the characteristics of the SQL dialect used  by the target database. This means that XPath injection attacks can be  much more adaptable and ubiquitous. Another advantage of an XPath  injection attack is that, unlike SQL, no ACLs are enforced, as our query  can access every part of the XML document.<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />The XPath attack pattern was first published by Amit Klein [1] and is  very similar to the usual SQL Injection. In order to get a first grasp  of the problem, let's imagine a login page that manages the  authentication to an application in which the user must enter his/her  username and password. Let's assume that our database is represented by  the following XML file: <br />&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt; <br />&lt;users&gt; <br />&lt;user&gt; <br />&lt;username&gt;gandalf&lt;/username&gt; <br />&lt;password&gt;!c3&lt;/password&gt; <br />&lt;account&gt;admin&lt;/account&gt; <br />&lt;/user&gt; <br />&lt;user&gt; <br />&lt;username&gt;Stefan0&lt;/username&gt; <br />&lt;password&gt;w1s3c&lt;/password&gt; <br />&lt;account&gt;guest&lt;/account&gt; <br />&lt;/user&gt; <br />&lt;user&gt; <br />&lt;username&gt;tony&lt;/username&gt; <br />&lt;password&gt;Un6R34kb!e&lt;/password&gt; <br />&lt;account&gt;guest&lt;/account&gt; <br />&lt;/user&gt; <br />&lt;/users&gt; <br /><br /> An XPath query that returns the account whose username is "gandalf" and the password is "!c3" would be the following: <br />string(//user[username/text()='gandalf' and password/text()='!c3']/account/text()) <br /><br /> If the application does not properly filter user input, the tester will  be able to inject XPath code and interfere with the query result. For  instance, the tester could input the following values: <br />Username: ' or '1' = '1 <br />Password: ' or '1' = '1 <br /><br /> Looks quite familiar, doesn't it? Using these parameters, the query becomes:  <br />string(//user[username/text()='' or '1' = '1' and password/text()='' or '1' = '1']/account/text()) <br /><br /> As in a common SQL Injection attack, we have created a query that always  evaluates to true, which means that the application will authenticate  the user even if a username or a password have not been provided. And as  in a common SQL Injection attack, with XPath injection, the first step  is to insert a single quote (') in the field to be tested, introducing a  syntax error in the query, and to check whether the application returns  an error message.  <br /><br /> If there is no knowledge about the XML data internal details and if the  application does not provide useful error messages that help us  reconstruct its internal logic, it is possible to perform a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_XPath_Injection">Blind XPath Injection</a>  attack, whose goal is to reconstruct the whole data structure. The  technique is similar to inference based SQL Injection, as the approach  is to inject code that creates a query that returns one bit of  information. <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_XPath_Injection">Blind XPath Injection</a> is explained in more detail by Amit Klein in the referenced paper. <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>Whitepapers</strong><br /> <br />•  [1] Amit Klein: "Blind XPath Injection" - <a href="http://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/bypass/Blind_XPath_Injection_20040518.pdf">http://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/bypass/Blind_XPath_Injection_20040518.pdf</a><br />•  [2] XPath 1.0 specifications - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath</a><br /><br /> <br /></div></body></html>
