<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">4.4.3 Test Account Provisioning Process (OTG-IDENT-003)  </h1><br/><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />The provisioning of accounts presents an opportunity for an attacker  to create a valid account without application of the proper  identification and authorization process.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Test objectives</h2><br />Verify which accounts may provision other accounts and of what type. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to test</h2><br />Determine which roles are able to provision users and what sort of accounts they can provision.  <br />•  Is there any verification, vetting and authorization of provisioning requests?<br />•  Is there any verification, vetting and authorization of de-provisioning requests?<br />•  Can an administrator provision other administrators or just users? <br />•  Can an administrator or other user provision accounts with privileges greater than their own?<br />•  Can an administrator or user de-provision themselves?<br />•  How are the files or resources owned by the de-provisioned user managed? Are they deleted? Is access transferred?<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Example</h3><br />In WordPress, only a user's name and email address are required to provision the user, as shown below: <br /><img src="images/199-1.png" alt="images/199-1.png" /> <br /><br /> De-provisioning of users requires the administrator to select the users  to be de-provisioned, select Delete from the dropdown menu (circled) and  then applying this action. The administrator is then presented with a  dialog box asking what to do with the user's posts (delete or transfer  them). <br /><img src="images/199-2.png" alt="images/199-2.png" /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />While the most thorough and accurate approach to completing this test  is to conduct it manually, HTTP proxy tools could be also useful. <br /></div></body></html>
