This section aims to help identify  and map out areas within the application that should be investigated  once enumeration and mapping have been completed. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Test Objectives</h2><br />Understand how requests are formed and typical responses from the application <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />Before any testing begins, the tester should always get a good  understanding of the application and how the user and browser  communicates with it.  As the tester walks through the application, they  should pay special attention to all HTTP requests (GET and POST  Methods, also known as Verbs), as well as every parameter and form field  that is passed to the application.  In addition, they should pay  attention to when GET requests are used and when POST requests are used  to pass parameters to the application.  It is very common that GET  requests are used, but when sensitive information is passed, it is often  done within the body of a POST request.   <br /><br /> Note that to see the parameters sent in a POST request, the tester will  need to use a tool such as an intercepting proxy (for example, OWASP: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project"> Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a>)  or a browser plug-in.  Within the POST request, the tester should also  make special note of any hidden form fields that are being passed to the  application, as these usually contain sensitive information, such as  state information, quantity of items, the price of items, that the  developer never intended for you to see or change.   <br /><br /> In the author's experience, it has been very useful to use an  intercepting proxy and a spreadsheet for this stage of the testing.  The  proxy will keep track of every request and response between the tester  and the application as they walk through it.  Additionally, at this  point, testers usually trap every request and response so that they can  see exactly every header, parameter, etc. that is being passed to the  application and what is being returned.  This can be quite tedious at  times, especially on large interactive sites (think of a banking  application). However, experience will show what to look for and this  phase can be significantly reduced.   <br /><br /> As the tester walks through the application, they should take note of  any interesting parameters in the URL, custom headers, or body of the  requests/responses, and save them in a spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet  should include the page requested (it might be good to also add the  request number from the proxy, for future reference), the interesting  parameters, the type of request (POST/GET), if access is  authenticated/unauthenticated, if SSL is used, if it's part of a  multi-step process, and any other relevant notes.  Once they have every  area of the application mapped out, then they can go through the  application and test each of the areas that they have identified and  make notes for what worked and what didn't work.  The rest of this guide  will identify how to test each of these areas of interest, but this  section must be undertaken before any of the actual testing can  commence. <br /><br /> Below are some points of interests for all requests and responses.   Within the requests section, focus on the GET and POST methods, as these  appear the majority of the requests.  Note that other methods, such as  PUT and DELETE, can be used. Often, these more rare requests, if  allowed, can expose vulnerabilities.  There is a special section in this  guide dedicated for testing these HTTP methods. <br /><br /> <strong>Requests:</strong> <br />•  Identify where GETs are used and where POSTs are used.<br />•  Identify all parameters used in a POST request (these are in the body of the request).<br />•  Within the POST request, pay special attention to any hidden parameters.  When a POST is sent all the form fields (including hidden parameters) will be sent in the body of the HTTP message to the application.  These typically aren't seen unless a proxy or view the HTML source code is used.  In addition, the next page shown, its data, and the level of access can all be different depending on the value of the hidden parameter(s).<br />•  Identify all parameters used in a GET request (i.e., URL), in particular the query string (usually after a ? mark).<br />•  Identify all the parameters of the query string. These usually are in a pair format, such as foo=bar. Also note that many parameters can be in one query string such as separated by a &amp;, ~, :, or any other special character or encoding.<br />•  A special note when it comes to identifying multiple parameters in one string or within a POST request is that some or all of the parameters will be needed to execute the attacks.  The tester needs to identify all of the parameters (even if encoded or encrypted) and identify which ones are processed by the application.  Later sections of the guide will identify how to test these parameters. At this point, just make sure each one of them is identified.<br />•  Also pay attention to any additional or custom type headers not typically seen (such as debug=False).<br /><br /> <strong>Responses:</strong> <br />• Identify where new cookies are set (Set-Cookie header), modified, or added to.<br />• Identify where there are any redirects (3xx HTTP status code), 400 status codes, in particular 403 Forbidden, and 500 internal server errors during normal responses (i.e., unmodified requests).<br />• Also note where any interesting headers are used. For example, "Server: BIG-IP" indicates that the site is load balanced. Thus, if a site is load balanced and one server is incorrectly configured, then the tester might have to make multiple requests to access the vulnerable server, depending on the type of load balancing used.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Black Box Testing</h3><br /><strong>Testing for application entry points:</strong> <br /> The following are two examples on how to check for application entry points.<br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>EXAMPLE 1</h3><br />This example shows a GET request that would purchase an item from an online shopping application. <br />GET <a href="https://x.x.x.x/shoppingApp/buyme.asp?CUSTOMERID=100&ITEM=z101a&PRICE=62.50&IP=x.x.x.x">https://x.x.x.x/shoppingApp/buyme.asp?CUSTOMERID=100&amp;ITEM=z101a&amp;PRICE=62.50&amp;IP=x.x.x.x</a> <br />Host: x.x.x.x<br />Cookie: SESSIONID=Z29vZCBqb2IgcGFkYXdhIG15IHVzZXJuYW1lIGlzIGZvbyBhbmQgcGFzc3dvcmQgaXMgYmFy<br /><br /> <strong>Result Expected:</strong> <br />Here the tester would note all the parameters of the request such  as CUSTOMERID, ITEM, PRICE, IP, and the Cookie (which could just be  encoded parameters or used for session state). <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>EXAMPLE 2</h3><br />This example shows a POST request that would log you into an application. <br />POST <a href="https://x.x.x.x/KevinNotSoGoodApp/authenticate.asp?service=login">https://x.x.x.x/KevinNotSoGoodApp/authenticate.asp?service=login</a><br />Host: x.x.x.x<br />Cookie: SESSIONID=dGhpcyBpcyBhIGJhZCBhcHAgdGhhdCBzZXRzIHByZWRpY3RhYmxlIGNvb2tpZXMgYW5kIG1pbmUgaXMgMTIzNA==<br />CustomCookie=00my00trusted00ip00is00x.x.x.x00<br />Body of the POST message: <br />user=admin&amp;pass=pass123&amp;debug=true&amp;fromtrustIP=true<br /><strong>Result Expected:</strong> <br />In this example the tester would note all the parameters as they  have before but notice that the parameters are passed in the body of the  message and not in the URL.  Additionally, note that there is a custom  cookie that is being used. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Gray Box Testing</h3><br />Testing for application entry points via a Gray Box methodology would  consist of everything already identified above with one addition.  In  cases where there are external sources from which the application  receives data and processes it (such as SNMP traps, syslog messages,  SMTP, or SOAP messages from other servers) a meeting with the  application developers could identify any functions that would accept or  expect user input and how they are formatted.  For example, the  developer could help in understanding how to formulate a correct SOAP  request that the application would accept and where the web service  resides (if the web service or any other function hasn't already been  identified during the black box testing). <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br /><strong>Intercepting Proxy:</strong><br /> <br />• OWASP: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project"> Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a><br />• OWASP: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project"> WebScarab</a><br />•  <a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/">Burp Suite</a><br />•  <a href="http://www.contextis.com/research/tools/cat/">CAT</a><br /><br /> <strong>Browser Plug-in:</strong><br /> <br />• <a href="http://www.bayden.com/TamperIE/">TamperIE for Internet Explorer</a><br />• <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966">Tamper Data for Firefox</a><br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>Whitepapers</strong><br /> <br />• <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> – Hypertext Transfer Protocol – HTTP 1.1 -<br /><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616</a> <br /></div></body></html>
