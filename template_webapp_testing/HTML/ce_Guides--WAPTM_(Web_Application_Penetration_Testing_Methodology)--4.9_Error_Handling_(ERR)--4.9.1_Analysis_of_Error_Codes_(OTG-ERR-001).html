It's possible to cause these errors to be displayed by using a  particular requests, either specially crafted with tools or created  manually. These codes are very useful to penetration testers during their  activities, because they reveal a lot of information about databases,  bugs, and other technological components directly linked with web  applications. <br />This section analyses the more common codes (error messages) and  bring into focus their relevance during a vulnerability assessment. The most important aspect for this activity is to focus one's attention  on these errors, seeing them as a collection of information that will  aid in the next steps of our analysis. A good collection can facilitate  assessment efficiency by decreasing the overall time taken to perform  the penetration test. <br />Attackers sometimes use search engines to locate errors that  disclose information. Searches can be performed to find any erroneous  sites as random victims, or it is possible to search for errors in a  specific site using the search engine filtering tools as described in <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Conduct_search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_for_information_leakage_(OTG-INFO-001)">4.2.1 Conduct Search Engine Discovery and Reconnaissance for Information Leakage (OTG-INFO-001)</a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Web Server Errors</h3><br />A common error that we can see during testing is the HTTP 404 Not Found. Often this error code provides useful details about the underlying web server and associated components. For example:  <br />Not Found<br />The requested URL /page.html was not found on this server.<br />Apache/2.2.3 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7g  DAV/2 PHP/5.1.2 Server at localhost Port 80<br />This error message can be generated by requesting a non-existent URL. After the common message that shows a page not found, there is  information about web server version, OS, modules and other products  used. This information can be very important from an OS and application type  and version identification point of view. <br />Other HTTP response codes such as 400 Bad Request, 405 Method Not  Allowed, 501 Method Not Implemented, 408 Request Time-out and 505 HTTP  Version Not Supported can be forced by an attacker. When receiving  specially crafted requests, web servers may provide one of these error  codes depending on their HTTP implementation.  <br />Testing for disclosed information in the Web Server error codes  is related testing for information disclosed in the HTTP headers as  described in the section <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fingerprint_Web_Server_(OTG-INFO-002)">Fingerprint Web Server (OTG-INFO-002)</a>.  <br /><br /><h3>Application Server Errors</h3><br />Application errors are returned by the application itself, rather  than the web server. These could be error messages from framework code  (ASP, JSP etc.) or they could be specific errors returned by the  application code.  Detailed application errors typically provide information of server  paths, installed libraries and application versions.  <br /><br /><h3>Database Errors</h3><br />Database errors are those returned by the Database System when there  is a problem with the query or the connection. Each Database system,  such as MySQL, Oracle or MSSQL, has their own set of errors. Those  errors can provide sensible information such as Database server IPs,  tables, columns and login details. <br />In addition, there are many SQL Injection exploitation techniques  that utilize detailed error messages from the database driver, for in  depth information on this issue see <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection_(OTG-INPVAL-005)">Testing for SQL Injection (OTG-INPVAL-005)</a> for more information. <br />Web server errors aren't the only useful output returned requiring security analysis. Consider the next example error message: <br />Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers (0x80004005)<br />[DBNETLIB][ConnectionOpen(Connect())] - SQL server does not exist or access denied <br />What happened? We will explain step-by-step below. <br />In this example, the 80004005 is a generic IIS error code which  indicates that it could not establish a connection to its associated  database. In many cases, the error message will detail the type of the  database. This will often indicate the underlying operating system by  association. With this information, the penetration tester can plan an  appropriate strategy for the security test. <br />By manipulating the variables that are passed to the database connect string, we can invoke more detailed errors. <br />Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80004005'<br />[Microsoft][ODBC Access 97 ODBC driver Driver]General error Unable to open registry key 'DriverId'<br />  In this example, we can see a generic error in the same situation  which reveals the type and version of the associated database system and  a dependence on Windows operating system registry key values. <br />Now we will look at a practical example with a security test  against a web application that loses its link to its database server and  does not handle the exception in a controlled manner. This could be  caused by a database name resolution issue, processing of unexpected  variable values, or other network problems. <br />Consider the scenario where we have a database administration web  portal, which can be used as a front end GUI to issue database queries,  create tables, and modify database fields. During the POST of the logon  credentials, the following error message is presented to the  penetration tester. The message indicates the presence of a MySQL  database server: <br />Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers (0x80004005)<br />[MySQL][ODBC 3.51 Driver]Unknown MySQL server host<br />If we see in the HTML code of the logon page the presence of a <strong>hidden field</strong>  with a database IP, we can try to change this value in the URL with the  address of database server under the penetration tester's control in an  attempt to fool the application into thinking that the logon was  successful. <br />Another example: knowing the database server that services a web  application, we can take advantage of this information to carry out a  SQL Injection for that kind of database or a persistent XSS test. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />Below are some examples of testing for detailed error messages  returned to the user. Each of the below examples has specific  information about the operating system, application version, etc. <br /><strong>Test: 404 Not Found</strong> <br />telnet &lt;host target&gt; 80<br />GET /&lt;wrong page&gt;

IIS is one of the commonly used web servers. Errors occur  in all applications, developers try to trap most errors but it is  almost impossible to cover each and every exception (it is however  possible to configure the web server to suppress detailed error messages  from being returned to the user).  <br />IIS uses a set of custom error pages generally found in  c:\winnt\help\iishelp\common to display errors like '404 page not found'  to the user. These default pages can be changed and custom errors can  be configured for IIS server. When IIS receives a request for an aspx  page, the request is passed on to the dot net framework. <br />There are various ways by which errors can be handled in dot net framework. Errors are handled at three places in ASP .net:  <br />1.  Inside Web.config customErrors section<br />2.  Inside global.asax Application_Error Sub<br />3.  At the the aspx or associated codebehind page in the Page_Error sub<br /><br /> <strong>Handling errors using web.config</strong> <br />&lt;customErrors defaultRedirect="myerrorpagedefault.aspx" mode="On|Off|RemoteOnly"&gt;<br />   &lt;error statusCode="404" redirect="myerrorpagefor404.aspx"/&gt;<br />   &lt;error statusCode="500" redirect="myerrorpagefor500.aspx"/&gt;<br />&lt;/customErrors&gt;<br />mode="On" will turn on custom errors. mode=RemoteOnly will show  custom errors to the remote web application users. A user accessing the  server locally will be presented with the complete stack trace and  custom errors will not be shown to him. <br />All the errors, except those explicitly specified, will cause a  redirection to the resource specified by defaultRedirect, i.e.,  myerrorpagedefault.aspx.  A status code 404 will be handled by myerrorpagefor404.aspx. <br /><br /> <strong>Handling errors in Global.asax</strong> <br />When an error occurs, the Application_Error sub is called. A  developer can write code for error handling/page redirection in this  sub. <br />Private Sub Application_Error (ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) <br />     Handles MyBase.Error<br />End Sub<br /><br /> <strong>Handling errors in Page_Error sub</strong> <br />This is similar to application error. <br />Private Sub Page_Error (ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) <br />     Handles MyBase.Error<br />End Sub<br /><br /> <strong>Error hierarchy in ASP .net</strong> <br />Page_Error sub will be processed first, followed by global.asax  Application_Error sub, and, finally, customErrors section in web.config  file. <br />Information Gathering on web applications with server-side  technology is quite difficult, but the information discovered can be  useful for the correct execution of an attempted exploit (for example,  SQL injection or Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks) and can reduce  false positives. <br /><br /> <strong>How to test for ASP.net and IIS Error Handling</strong> <br />Fire up your browser and type a random page name  <br />http:\\www.mywebserver.com\anyrandomname.asp<br />If the server returns  <br />The page cannot be found<br /><br />Internet Information Services<br />it means that IIS custom errors are not configured. Please note the .asp extension. <br />Also test for .net custom errors. Type a random page name with aspx extension in your browser <br />http:\\www.mywebserver.com\anyrandomname.aspx<br />If the server returns <br />Server Error in '/' Application.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The resource cannot be found. <br />Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly. <br />custom errors for .net are not configured. <br /><br /><h3>Error Handling in Apache</h3><br />Apache is a common HTTP server for serving HTML and PHP web pages. By  default, Apache shows the server version, products installed and OS  system in the HTTP error responses. <br />Responses to the errors can be configured and customized  globally, per site or per directory in the apache2.conf using the  ErrorDocument directive [2] <br />ErrorDocument 404 “Customized Not Found error message”<br />ErrorDocument 403 /myerrorpagefor403.html<br />ErrorDocument 501 http://www.externaldomain.com/errorpagefor501.html<br />Site administrators are able to manage their own errors using  .htaccess file if the global directive AllowOverride is configured  properly in apache2.conf [3] <br />The information shown by Apache in the HTTP errors can also be  configured using the directives ServerTokens [4] and ServerSignature [5]  at apache2.conf configuration file. “ServerSignature Off” (On by  default) removes the server information from the error responses, while  ServerTokens [ProductOnly|Major|Minor|Minimal|OS|Full] (Full by default)  defines what information has to be shown in the error pages. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Error Handling in Tomcat</h3><br />Tomcat is a HTTP server to host JSP and Java Servlet applications. By  default, Tomcat shows the server version in the HTTP error responses. <br />Customization of the error responses can be configured in the configuration file web.xml. <br />&lt;error-page&gt;<br />	&lt;error-code&gt;404&lt;/error-code&gt;<br />	&lt;location&gt;/myerrorpagefor404.html&lt;/location&gt;<br />&lt;/error-page&gt; <br /></div></body></html>
