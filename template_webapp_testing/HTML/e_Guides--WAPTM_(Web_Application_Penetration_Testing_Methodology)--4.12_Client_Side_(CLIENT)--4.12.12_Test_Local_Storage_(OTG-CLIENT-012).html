There are two objects, localStorage  that is persistent and is intended to survive browser/system reboots and  sessionStorage that is temporary and will only exists until the window  or tab is closed.  <br /><br /> On average browsers allow to store in this storage around 5MB per  domain, that compared to the 4KB of cookies is a big difference, but the  key difference from the security perspective is that the data stored in  these two objects is kept in the client and never sent to the server,  this also improves network performance as data do not need to travel  over the wire back and forth. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>localStorage</h3><br />Access to the storage is normally done using the setItem and getItem  functions. The storage can be read from javascript which means with a  single XSS an attacker would be able to extract all the data from the  storage. Also malicious data can be loaded into the storage via  JavaScript so the application needs to have the controls in place to  treat untrusted data. Check if there are more than one application in  the same domain like example.foo/app1 and example.foo/app2 because those  will share the  same  storage. <br /><br /> Data stored in this object will persist after the window is closed, it  is a bad idea to store sensitive data or session identifiers on this  object as these can be accesed via JavaScript. Session IDs stored in  cookies can mitigate this risk using the httpOnly flag. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>sessionStorage</h3><br />The main difference with localStorage is that the data stored in this  object is only accessible until the tab/window is closed, which makes  localStorage a perfect candidate for data that doesn't need to be  persisted between sessions. It shares most of the properties and the  getItem/setItem methods, so manual testing needs to be undertaken to  look for these methods and identify in which parts of the code the  storage is accessed. <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br /><br /><h3>Black Box testing</h3><br />Black box testing for issues within the Local Storage code is not  usually performed since access to the source code is always available as  it needs to be sent to the client to be executed. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Gray Box testing</h3><br />First of all, we need to check whether the Local Storage is used. <br /><br /> <strong>Example 1: Access to localStorage:</strong> <br /> <br />Access to every element in localStorage with JavaScript:<br /> <br />for(var i=0; i&lt;localStorage.length; i++) {                                               <br />        console.log(localStorage.key(i), " = ", localStorage.getItem(localStorage.key(i)));<br />}<br />same code can be applied to sessionStorage <br /><br /> Using Google Chrome, click on menu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Developer Tools.  Then under Resources you will see 'Local Storage' and 'Web Storage'. <br /><img src="images/93-1.png" alt="images/93-1.png" /> <br /><br /> Using Firefox with the Firebug add on you can easily inspect the localStorage/sessionStorage object in the DOM tab. <br /><img src="images/93-2.png" alt="images/93-2.png" /> <br /><br /> Also, we can inspect these objects from the developer tools of our browser. <br /><br /> Next manual testing needs to be conducted in order to determine whether  the website is storing sensitive data in the storage that represents a  risk and will increase dramatically the impact of an information leak.  Also check the code handling the Storage to determine if it is  vulnerable to injection attacks, common issue when the code does not  escape the input or output. The JavaScript code has to be analyzed to  evaluate these issues, so make sure you crawl the application to  discover every instance of JavaScript code and note sometimes  applications use third-party libraries that would need to be examined  too.<br /> <br /> Here is an example of how improper use of user input and lack of validation can lead to XSS attacks. <br /><strong>Example 2: XSS in localStorage:</strong> <br /> <br />Insecure assignment from localStorage can lead to XSS<br /> <br />function action(){<br /><br />var resource = location.hash.substring(1);<br /><br />localStorage.setItem("item",resource);<br /><br />item = localStorage.getItem("item");<br />document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML=item;<br />}<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />&lt;body onload="action()"&gt;<br />&lt;div id="div1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt; <br />URL PoC: <br /><a href="http://server/StoragePOC.html#">http://server/StoragePOC.html#</a>&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;<br /><img src="images/93-3.png" alt="images/93-3.png" /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />•  <strong>Firebug</strong> -  <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">http://getfirebug.com/</a><br />•  <strong>Google Chrome Developer Tools</strong> - <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/">https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/</a><br />•  <strong>OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</strong> - <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project</a><br />ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding  vulnerabilities in web applications. It is designed to be used by  people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for  developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing.  ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you  to find security vulnerabilities manually. <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>OWASP Resources</strong> <br />• <strong>OWASP HTML5 Security Cheat Sheet</strong>: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet</a><br /><br /> <strong>Whitepapers</strong> <br />• <strong>Web Storage Specification</strong>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/</a><br /></div></body></html>
