The identity  requirements for access vary from positive identification to none at  all, depending on the security requirements of the system. Many public  applications completely automate the registration and provisioning  process because the size of the user base makes it impossible to manage  manually. However, many corporate applications will provision users  manually, so this test case may not apply.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Test objectives</h2><br />1. Verify that the identity requirements for user registration are aligned with business and security requirements. <br />2. Validate the registration process.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to test</h2><br />Verify that the identity requirements for user registration are aligned with business and security requirements: <br />1.  Can anyone register for access?<br />2.  Are registrations vetted by a human prior to provisioning, or are they automatically granted if the criteria are met?<br />3.  Can the same person or identity register multiple times?<br />4.  Can users register for different roles or permissions?<br />5.  What proof of identity is required for a registration to be successful?<br />6.  Are registered identities verified?<br />Validate the registration process: <br />1.  Can identity information be easily forged or faked?<br />2.  Can the exchange of identity information be manipulated during registration?<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Example</h3><br />In the WordPress example below, the only identification requirement is an email address that is accessible to the registrant.  <br /><img src="images/198-1.png" alt="images/198-1.png" /> <br /><br /> In contrast, in the Google example below the identification requirements  include name, date of birth, country, mobile phone number, email  address and CAPTCHA response. While only two of these can be verified  (email address and mobile number), the identification requirements are  stricter than WordPress. <br /><img src="images/198-2.png" alt="images/198-2.png" /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />A HTTP proxy can be a useful tool to test this control. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/09/user-registration-design/">User Registration Design</a> <br /><br /> <br /></div></body></html>
