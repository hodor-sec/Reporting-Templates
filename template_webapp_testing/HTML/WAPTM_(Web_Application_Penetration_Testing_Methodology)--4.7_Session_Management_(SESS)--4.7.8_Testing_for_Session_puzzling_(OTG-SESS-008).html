An attacker can potentially  access pages in an order unanticipated by the developers so that the  session variable is set in one context and then used in another. <br /><br /> For example, an attacker could use session variable overloading to  bypass authentication enforcement mechanisms of applications that  enforce authentication by validating the existence of session variables  that contain identity–related values, which are usually stored in the  session after a successful authentication process. This means an  attacker first accesses a location in the application that sets session  context and then accesses privileged locations that examine this  context.  <br /><br /> For example - an authentication bypass attack vector could be executed  by accessing a publicly accessible entry point (e.g. a password recovery  page) that populates the session with an identical session variable,  based on fixed values or on user originating input. <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br /><br /><h3>Black Box Testing</h3><br />This vulnerability can be detected and exploited by enumerating all  of the session variables used by the application and in which context  they are valid. In particular this is possible by accessing a sequence  of entry points and then examining exit points. In case of black box  testing this procedure is difficult and requires some luck since every  different sequence could lead to a different result.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Examples</h3><br />A very simple example could be the password reset functionality that,  in the entry point, could request the user to provide  some identifying  information such as the username or the e-mail address. This page might  then populate the session with these identifying values, which are  received directly from the client side, or obtained from queries or  calculations based on the received input. At this point there may be  some pages in the application that show private data based on this  session object. In this manner the attacker could bypass the  authentication process. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Gray Box testing</h3><br />The most effective way to detect these vulnerabilities is via a source code review. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>Whitepapers</strong><br /> <br />•  Session Puzzles: <a href="http://puzzlemall.googlecode.com/files/Session%20Puzzles%20-%20Indirect%20Application%20Attack%20Vectors%20-%20May%202011%20-%20Whitepaper.pdf">http://puzzlemall.googlecode.com/files/Session%20Puzzles%20-%20Indirect%20Application%20Attack%20Vectors%20-%20May%202011%20-%20Whitepaper.pdf</a><br />•  Session Puzzling and Session Race Conditions: <a href="http://sectooladdict.blogspot.com/2011/09/session-puzzling-and-session-race.html">http://sectooladdict.blogspot.com/2011/09/session-puzzling-and-session-race.html</a><br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Remediation</h2><br />Session variables should only be used for a single consistent purpose. <br /></div></body></html>
