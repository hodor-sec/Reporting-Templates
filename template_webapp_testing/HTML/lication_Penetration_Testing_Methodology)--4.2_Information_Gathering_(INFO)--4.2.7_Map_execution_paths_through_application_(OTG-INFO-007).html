Without a thorough understanding of the  layout of the application, it is unlkely that it will be tested  thoroughly.   <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Test Objectives</h2><br />Map the target application and understand the principal workflows. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />In black box testing it is extremely difficult to test the entire  code base. Not just because the tester has no view of the code paths  through the application, but even if they did, to test all code paths  would be very time consuming. One way to reconcile this is to document  what code paths were discovered and tested.  <br /><br /> There are several ways to approach the testing and measurement of code coverage: <br />•  <strong>Path</strong> - test each of the paths through an application that includes combinatorial and boundary value analysis testing for each decision path. While this approach offers thoroughness, the number of testable paths grows exponentially with each decision branch.<br />•  <strong>Data flow (or taint analysis)</strong> - tests the assignment of variables via external interaction (normally users). Focuses on mapping the flow, transformation and use of data throughout an application.<br />•  <strong>Race</strong> - tests multiple concurrent instances of the application manipulating the same data.<br /><br /> The trade off as to what method is used and to what degree each method  is used should be negotiated with the application owner. Simpler  approaches could also be adopted, including asking the application owner  what functions or code sections they are particularly concerned about  and how those code segments can be reached. <br /><br /> <strong> Black Box Testing </strong> <br />To demonstrate code coverage to the application owner, the tester  can start with a spreadsheet and document all the links discovered by  spidering the application (either manually or automatically). Then the  tester can look more closely at decision points in the application and  investigate how many significant code paths are discovered. These should  then be documented in the spreadsheet with URLs, prose and screenshot  descriptions of the paths discovered. <br /><br /> <strong> Gray/White Box testing </strong>  <br />Ensuring sufficient code coverage for the application owner is  far easier with the gray and white box approach to testing. Information  solicited by and provided to the tester will ensure the minimum  requirements for code coverage are met.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Example</h3><br /><strong> Automatic Spidering </strong> <br />The automatic spider is a tool used to automatically discover new  resources (URLs) on a particular website. It begins with a list of URLs  to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is started.  While there are a lot of Spidering tools, the following example uses  the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/">Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a>:  <br /><img src="images/182-1.png" alt="images/182-1.png" /><br /><br /> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/">ZAP</a> offers the following automatic spidering features, which can be selected based on the tester's needs: <br />• Spider Site - The seed list contains all the existing URIs already found for the selected site.<br />• Spider Subtree - The seed list contains all the existing URIs already found and present in the subtree of the selected node.<br />• Spider URL - The seed list contains only the URI corresponding to the selected node (in the Site Tree).<br />• Spider all in Scope - The seed list contains all the URIs the user has selected as being 'In Scope'.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />•  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/">Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a><br />•  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spreadsheet_software">List of spreadsheet software</a><br />•  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagramming_software">Diagramming software</a><br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>Whitepapers</strong> <br />[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage</a> <br /></div></body></html>
