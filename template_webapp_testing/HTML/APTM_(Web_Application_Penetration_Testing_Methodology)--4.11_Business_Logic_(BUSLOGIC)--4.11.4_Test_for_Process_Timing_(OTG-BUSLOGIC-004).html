Additionally, attackers may be able to manipulate and break  designed business process flows by simply keeping active sessions open  and not submitting their transactions in the "expected" time frame.     <br /><br /> Process timing logic vulnerabilities is unique in that these manual  misuse cases should be created considering execution and transaction  timing that are application/system specific.   <br /><br /> Processing timing may give/leak information on what is being done in the  application/system background processes. If an application allows users  to guess what the particulate next outcome will be by processing time  variations, users will be able to adjust accordingly and change behavior  based on the expectation and "game the system".   <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Example</h2><br />Example 1 <br />Video gambling/slot machines may take longer to process a  transaction just prior to a large payout. This would allow astute  gamblers to gamble minimum amounts until they see the long process time  which would then prompt them to bet the maximum.   <br /><br /> Example 2 <br />Many system log on processes ask for the user name and password.  If you look closely you may be able to see that entering an invalid user  name and invalid user password takes more time to return an error than  entering a valid username and invalid user password. This may allow the  attacker to know if they have a valid username and not need to rely on  the GUI message.     <br /><br /> Example 3 <br />Most Arenas or travel agencies have ticketing applications that  allow users to purchase tickets and reserve seats. When the user  requests the tickets seats are locked or reserved pending payment. What  if an attacker keeps reserving seats but not checking out? Will the  seats be released, or will no tickets be sold? Some ticket vendors now  only allow users 5 minutes to complete a transaction or the transaction  is invalidated.  <br /><br /> Example 4 <br />Suppose a precious metals e-commerce site allows users to make  purchases with a price quote based on market price at the time they log  on. What if an attacker logs on and places an order but does not  complete the transaction until later in the day only of the price of the  metals goes up? Will the attacker get the initial lower price?     <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />• Review the project documentation and use exploratory testing  looking for application/system functionality that may be impacted by  time. Such as execution time or actions that help users predict a future  outcome or allow one to circumvent any part of the business logic or  workflow. For example, not completing transactions in an expected time.      <br />• Develop and execute the mis-use cases ensuring that attackers can not gain an advantage based on any timing.       <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Related Test Cases</h2><br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_cookies_attributes_(OTG-SESS-002)"> Testing for Cookies attributes (OTG-SESS-002)</a>  <br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Session_Timeout_(OTG-SESS-007)"> Test Session Timeout (OTG-SESS-007)</a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br />None <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Remediation</h2><br />Develop applications with processing time in mind. If attackers could  possibly gain some type of advantage from knowing the different  processing times and results add extra steps or processing so that no  matter the results they are provided in the same time frame.  <br /><br /> Additionally, the application/system must have mechanism in place to not  allow attackers to extend transactions over an "acceptable" amount of  time. This may be done by cancelling or resetting transactions after a  specified amount of time has passed like some ticket vendors are now  using. <br /></div></body></html>
