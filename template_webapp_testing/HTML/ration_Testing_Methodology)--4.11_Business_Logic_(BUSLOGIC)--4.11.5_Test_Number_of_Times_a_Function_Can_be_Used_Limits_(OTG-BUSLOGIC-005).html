Applications must be “smart enough” to not allow the user to exceed  their limit on the use of these functions since in many cases each time  the function is used the user may gain some type of benefit that must be  accounted for to properly compensate the owner. For example: an  eCommerce site may only allow a users apply a discount once per  transaction, or some applications may be on a subscription plan and only  allow users to download three complete documents monthly. <br /><br /> Vulnerabilities related to testing for the function limits are  application specific and misuse cases must be created that strive to  exercise parts of the application/functions/ or actions more than the  allowable number of times.   <br /><br /> Attackers may be able to circumvent the business logic and execute a  function more times than “allowable” exploiting the application for  personal gain.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Example</h2><br />Suppose an eCommerce site allows users to take advantage of any one  of many discounts on their total purchase and then proceed to checkout  and tendering. What happens of the attacker navigates back to the  discounts page after taking and applying the one “allowable” discount?  Can they take advantage of another discount? Can they take advantage of  the same discount multiple times?  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />• Review the project documentation and use exploratory testing  looking for functions or features in the application or system that  should not be executed more that a single time or specified number of  times during the business logic workflow.    <br />• For each of the functions and features found that should only  be executed a single time or specified number of times during the  business logic workflow, develop abuse/misuse cases that may allow a  user to execute more than the allowable number of times. For example,  can a user navigate back and forth through the pages multiple times  executing a function that should only execute once? or can a user load  and unload shopping carts allowing for additional discounts.        <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Related Test Cases</h2><br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OTG-IDENT-004)"> Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account (OTG-IDENT-004) </a> <br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_lock_out_mechanism_(OTG-AUTHN-003)"> Testing for Weak lock out mechanism (OTG-AUTHN-003)</a>  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br />InfoPath Forms Services business logic exceeded the maximum limit of operations Rule - <a href="http://mpwiki.viacode.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=115678">http://mpwiki.viacode.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=115678</a> <br />Gold Trading Was Temporarily Halted On The CME This Morning - <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gold-halted-on-cme-for-stop-logic-event-2013-10">http://www.businessinsider.com/gold-halted-on-cme-for-stop-logic-event-2013-10</a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Remediation</h2><br />The application should have checks to ensure that the business logic  is being followed and that if a function/action can only be executed a  certain number of times, when the limit is reached the user can no  longer execute the function. To prevent users from using a function over  the appropriate number of times the application may use mechanisms such  as cookies to keep count or through sessions not allowing users to  access to execute the function additional times. <br /></div></body></html>
