<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Session Management</h1><br/><table class="table"><col/><col/><col/><tr><th>Best Practice</th><th>Description</th><th>CWE ID</th></tr><tr><td>Ensure That Session Identifiers Are Sufficiently Random</td><td>Session tokens must be generated by secure random functions and must be of a sufficient length so as to withstand analysis and prediction.</td><td>cwe-6</td></tr><tr><td>Regenerate Session Tokens</td><td>Session tokens should be regenerated when the user authenticates to theapplication and when the user privilege level changes. Additionally, shouldthe encryption status change, the session token should always be regenerated</td><td>cwe-384</td></tr><tr><td>Implement an Idle Session Timeout</td><td>When a user is not active, the application should automatically log the user out. Be aware that Ajax applications may make recurring calls to the application effectively resetting the timeout counter automatically.</td><td>cwe-613</td></tr><tr><td>Implement an Absolute Session Timeout</td><td>Users should be logged out after an extensive amount of time (e.g. 4-8 hours) has passed since they logged in. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker using a hijacked session.</td><td>cwe-613</td></tr><tr><td>Destroy Sessions at Any Sign of Tampering</td><td>Unless the application requires multiple simultaneous sessions for a single user, implement features to detect session cloning attempts. Should any sign of session cloning be detected, the session should be destroyed, forcing the real user to re-authenticate.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidate the Session after Logout</td><td>When the user logs out of the application the session and corresponding data on the server must be destroyed. This ensures that the session can not be accidentally revived.</td><td>cwe-613</td></tr><tr><td>Place a Logout Button on Every Page</td><td>The logout button or logout link should be easily accessible to the user on every page after they have authenticated.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Use Secure Cookie Attributes (i.e. HttpOnly and Secure Flags)</td><td>The session cookie should be set with both the HttpOnly and the Secure flags. This ensures that the session id will not be accessible to client-side scripts and it will only be transmitted over HTTPS, respectively.</td><td>cwe-79
cwe-614</td></tr><tr><td>Set the Cookie Domain and Path Correctly</td><td>The cookie domain and path scope should be set to the most restrictive settings for your application. Any wildcard domain scoped cookie must have a good justification for its existence.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Set the Cookie Expiration Time</td><td>The session cookie should have a reasonable expiration time. Non-expiring session cookies should be avoided.</td><td></td></tr></table><br /></div></body></html>
