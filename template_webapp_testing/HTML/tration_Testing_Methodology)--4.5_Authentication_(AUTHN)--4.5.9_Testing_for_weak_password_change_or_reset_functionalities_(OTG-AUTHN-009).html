This  self-service mechanism allows users to quickly change or reset their  password without an administrator intervening. When passwords are  changed they are typically changed within the application. When  passwords are reset they are either rendered within the application or  emailed to the user. This may indicate that the passwords are stored in  plain text or in a decryptable format. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Test objectives</h2><br />1. Determine the resistance of the application to subversion of the account change process allowing someone to change the password of an account.<br />2. Determine the resistance of the passwords reset functionality against guessing or bypassing.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />For both password change and password reset it is important to check: <br />1.  if users, other than administrators, can change or reset passwords for accounts other than their own.<br />2.  if users can manipulate or subvert the password change or reset process to change or reset the password of another user or administrator.<br />3.  if the password change or reset process is vulnerable to <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_CSRF_(OWASP-SM-005)">CSRF</a>.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Test Password Reset</h3><br />In addition to the previous checks it is important to verify the following: <br />•  What information is required to reset the password?<br />The first step is to check whether secret questions are required.  Sending the password (or a password reset link) to the user email  address without first asking for a secret question means relying 100% on  the security of that email address, which is not suitable if the  application needs a high level of security.<br /> On the other hand, if secret questions are used, the next step is to  assess their strength. This specific test is discussed in detail in the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_security_question/answer_(OTG-AUTHN-008)">Testing for Weak security question/answer</a> paragraph of this guide. <br /> <br />•  How are reset passwords communicated to the user?<br />The most insecure scenario here is if the password reset tool shows  you the password; this gives the attacker the ability to log into the  account, and unless the application provides information about the last  log in the victim would not know that their account has been  compromised.<br /> A less insecure scenario is if the password reset tool forces the user  to immediately change their password. While not as stealthy as the first  case, it allows the attacker to gain access and locks the real user  out.<br /> The best security is achieved if the password reset is done via an email  to the address the user initially registered with, or some other email  address; this forces the attacker to not only guess at which email  account the password reset was sent to (unless the application show this  information) but also to compromise that email account in order to  obtain the temporary password or the password reset link. <br /> <br />•  Are reset passwords generated randomly?<br />The most insecure scenario here is if the application sends or  visualizes the old password in clear text because this means that  passwords are not stored in a hashed form, which is a security issue in  itself.<br /> The best security is achieved if passwords are randomly generated with a secure algorithm that cannot be derived. <br /> <br />•  Is the reset password functionality requesting confirmation before changing the password?<br />To limit denial-of-service attacks the application should email a  link to the user with a random token, and only if the user visits the  link then the reset procedure is completed. This ensures that the  current password will still be valid until the reset has been confirmed. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Test Password Change</h3><br />In addition to the previous test it is important to verify: <br />•  Is the old password requested to complete the change?<br />The most insecure scenario here is if the application permits the  change of the password without requesting the current password. Indeed  if an attacker is able to take control of a valid session they could  easily change the victim's password.<br /> <br />See also <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_password_policy_(OWASP-AT-008)">Testing for Weak password policy</a> paragraph of this guide. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br />•  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet">OWASP Forgot Password Cheat Sheet</a><br />•  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Periodic_Table_of_Vulnerabilities_-_Insufficient_Password_Recovery">OWASP Periodic Table of Vulnerabilities - Insufficient Password Recovery</a><br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Remediation</h2><br />The password change or reset function is a sensitive function and  requires some form of protection, such as requiring users to  re-authenticate or presenting the user with confirmation screens during  the process. <br /></div></body></html>
