<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Google operators / dorks</h1><br/><strong>Popular Google Dork operators</strong><br /><br />Google’s search engine has its own built-in query language. The following list of queries can be run to find a list of files, find information about your competition, track people, get information about SEO backlinks, build email lists, and of course, discover web vulnerabilities.<br /><br />Let’s look at the most popular Google Dorks and what they do.<br /><br />    cache: this dork will show you the cached version of any website, e.g. cache: securitytrails.com<br />    allintext: searches for specific text contained on any web page, e.g. allintext: hacking tools<br />    allintitle: exactly the same as allintext, but will show pages that contain titles with X characters, e.g. allintitle:"Security Companies"<br />    allinurl: it can be used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters, e.g: allinurl client area<br />    filetype: used to search for any kind of file extensions, for example, if you want to search for jpg files you can use: filetype: jpg<br />    inurl: this is exactly the same as allinurl, but it is only useful for one single keyword, e.g. inurl: admin<br />    intitle: used to search for various keywords inside the title, for example, intitle:security tools will search for titles beginning with “security” but “tools” can be somewhere else in the page.<br />    inanchor: this is useful when you need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links, e.g. inanchor:"cyber security"<br />    intext: useful to locate pages that contain certain characters or strings inside their text, e.g. intext:"safe internet"<br />    link: will show the list of web pages that have links to the specified URL, e.g. link: microsoft.com<br />    site: will show you the full list of all indexed URLs for the specified domain and subdomain, e.g. site:securitytrails.com<br />    *: wildcard used to search pages that contain “anything” before your word, e.g. how to * a website, will return “how to…” design/create/hack, etc… “a website”.<br />    |: this is a logical operator, e.g. "security" "tips" will show all the sites which contain “security” or “tips,” or both words.<br />    +: used to concatenate words, useful to detect pages that use more than one specific key, e.g. security + trails<br />    –: minus operator is used to avoiding showing results that contain certain words, e.g. security -trails will show pages that use “security” in their text, but not those that have the word “trails.”<br /></div></body></html>
