The goal of the attacker is to send HTTP POST/GET requests  through an intercepting proxy with data values that is not supported,  guarded against or expected by the applications business logic. Some  examples of forged requests include exploiting guessable or predictable  parameters or expose “hidden” features and functionality such as  enabling debugging or presenting special screens or windows that are  very useful during development but may leak information or bypass the  business logic. <br /><br /> Vulnerabilities related to the ability to forge requests is unique to  each application and different from business logic data validation in  that it s focus is on breaking the business logic workflow. <br /><br /> Applications should have logic checks in place to prevent the system  from accepting  forged requests that may allow attackers the opportunity  to exploit the business logic, process, or flow of the application.  Request forgery is nothing new; the attacker uses an intercepting proxy  to send HTTP POST/GET requests to the application. Through request  forgeries attackers may be able to circumvent the business logic or  process by finding, predicting and manipulating parameters to make the  application think a process or task has or has not taken place.  <br /><br /> Also, forged requests may allow subvention of programmatic or business  logic flow by invoking “hidden” features or functionality such as  debugging initially used by developers and testers sometimes referred to  as an ”Easter egg”. “An Easter egg is an intentional inside joke,  hidden message, or feature in a work such as a computer program, movie,  book, or crossword. According to game designer Warren Robinett, the term  was coined at Atari by personnel who were alerted to the presence of a  secret message which had been hidden by Robinett in his already widely  distributed game, Adventure. The name has been said to evoke the idea of  a traditional Easter egg hunt.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)</a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Examples</h2><br />Example 1 <br />Suppose an e-commerce theater site allows users to select their  ticket, apply a onetime 10% Senior discount on the entire sale, view the  subtotal and tender the sale. If an attacker is able to see through a  proxy that the application has a hidden field (of 1 or 0) used by the  business logic to determine if a discount has been taken or not. The  attacker is then able to submit the 1 or “no discount has been taken”  value multiple times to take advantage of the same discount multiple  times.         <br /><br /> Example 2  <br />Suppose an online video game pays out tokens for points scored  for finding pirates treasure and pirates and for each level completed.  These tokens can later be that can later be exchanged for prizes.  Additionally each level's points have a multiplier value equal to the  level. If an attacker was able to see through a proxy that the  application has a hidden field used during development and testing to  quickly get to the highest levels of the game they could quickly get to  the highest levels and accumulate unearned points quickly.     <br /><br /> Also, if an attacker was able to see through a proxy that the  application has a hidden field used during development and testing to  enabled a log that indicated where other online players, or hidden  treasure were in relation to the attacker, they would then be able to  quickly go to these locations and score points.    <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br />Generic Testing Method <br />• Review the project documentation and use exploratory testing  looking for guessable, predictable or hidden functionality of fields. <br />• Once found try to insert logically valid data into the  application/system allowing the user go through the application/system  against the normal busineess logic workflow. <br /><br /> Specific Testing Method 1 <br />• Using an intercepting proxy observe the HTTP POST/GET looking  for some indication that values are incrementing at a regular interval  or are easily guessable.  <br />• If it is found that some value is guessable this value may be changed and one may gain unexpected visibility.  <br /><br /> Specific Testing Method 2 <br />• Using an intercepting proxy observe the HTTP POST/GET looking  for some indication of hidden features such as debug that can be  switched on or activated.  <br />• If any are found try to guess and change these values to get a different application  response or behavior.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Related Test Cases</h2><br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Exposed_Session_Variables_(OTG-SESS-004)"> Testing for Exposed Session Variables (OTG-SESS-004)</a>  <br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_CSRF_(OTG-SESS-005)"> Testing for Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (OTG-SESS-005)</a>  <br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OTG-IDENT-004)"> Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account (OTG-IDENT-004) </a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br /><em>OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</em> - <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project</a> <br />ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for  finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is designed to be used  by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal  for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration  testing. ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that  allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br />Cross Site Request Forgery - Legitimizing Forged Requests -  <a href="http://fragilesecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/cross-site-request-forgery-legitimazing.html">http://fragilesecurity.blogspot.com/2012/11/cross-site-request-forgery-legitimazing.html</a> <br />Debugging features which remain present in the final game -  <a href="http://glitchcity.info/wiki/index.php/List_of_video_games_with_debugging_features#Debugging_features_which_remain_present_in_the_final_game">http://glitchcity.info/wiki/index.php/List_of_video_games_with_debugging_features#Debugging_features_which_remain_present_in_the_final_game</a> <br />Easter egg - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)</a> <br />Top 10 Software Easter Eggs - <a href="http://lifehacker.com/371083/top-10-software-easter-eggs">http://lifehacker.com/371083/top-10-software-easter-eggs</a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Remediation</h2><br />The application must be smart enough and designed with business logic  that will prevent attackers from predicting and manipulating parameters  to subvert programmatic or business logic flow, or exploiting  hidden/undocumented functionality such as debugging. <br /></div></body></html>
