While this behavior is consistent with RFCs and Web  Standards, using standard file extensions provides the penetration  tester useful information about the underlying technologies used in a  web appliance and greatly simplifies the task of determining the attack  scenario to be used on particular technologies. In addition,  mis-configuration of web servers could easily reveal confidential  information about access credentials. <br /><br /> Extension checking is often used to validate files to be uploaded, which  can lead to unexpected results because the content is not what is  expected, or because of unexpected OS file name handling. <br /><br /> Determining how web servers handle requests corresponding to files  having different extensions may help in understanding web server  behavior depending on the kind of files that are accessed. For example,  it can help to understand which file extensions are returned as text or  plain versus those that cause execution on the server side. The latter  are indicative of technologies, languages or plugins that are used by  web servers or application servers, and may provide additional insight  on how the web application is engineered. For example, a “.pl” extension  is usually associated with server-side Perl support. However, the file  extension alone may be deceptive and not fully conclusive. For example,  Perl server-side resources might be renamed to conceal the fact that  they are indeed Perl related. See the next section on “web server  components” for more on identifying server side technologies and  components. <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br /><br /><h3>Forced browsing</h3><br />Submit http[s] requests involving different file extensions and  verify how they are handled. The verification should be on a per web  directory basis. Verify directories that allow script execution. Web  server directories can be identified by vulnerability scanners, which  look for the presence of well-known directories. In addition, mirroring  the web site structure allows the tester to reconstruct the tree of web  directories served by the application. <br /><br /> If the web application architecture is load-balanced, it is important to  assess all of the web servers. This may or may not be easy, depending  on the configuration of the balancing infrastructure. In an  infrastructure with redundant components there may be slight variations  in the configuration of individual web or application servers. This may  happen if the web architecture employs heterogeneous technologies (think  of a set of IIS and Apache web servers in a load-balancing  configuration, which may introduce slight asymmetric behavior between  them, and possibly different vulnerabilities).  <br /><br /> '<em>Example:</em> <br />The tester has identified the existence of a file named  connection.inc. Trying to access it directly gives back its contents,  which are: <br />&lt;?<br />   	mysql_connect("127.0.0.1", "root", "")<br />        or die("Could not connect");<br /> <br />?&gt;<br /><br /> The tester determines the existence of a MySQL DBMS back end, and the  (weak) credentials used by the web application to access it. <br /><br /> The following file extensions should never be returned by a web server,  since they are related to files which may contain sensitive information  or to files for which there is no reason to be served. <br />•  .asa<br />•  .inc<br /><br /> The following file extensions are related to files which, when accessed,  are either displayed or downloaded by the browser. Therefore, files  with these extensions must be checked to verify that they are indeed  supposed to be served (and are not leftovers), and that they do not  contain sensitive information. <br />•  .zip, .tar, .gz, .tgz, .rar, ...: (Compressed) archive files<br />•  .java: No reason to provide access to Java source files<br />•  .txt: Text files<br />•  .pdf: PDF documents<br />•  .doc, .rtf, .xls, .ppt, ...: Office documents<br />•  .bak, .old and other extensions indicative of backup files (for example: ~ for Emacs backup files)<br /><br /> The list given above details only a few examples, since file extensions  are too many to be comprehensively treated here. Refer to <a href="http://filext.com/">http://filext.com/</a> for a more thorough database of extensions. <br /><br /> To identify files having a given extensions a mix of techniques can be  employed. THese techniques can include Vulnerability Scanners, spidering  and mirroring tools, manually inspecting the application (this  overcomes limitations in automatic spidering), querying search engines  (see <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spidering_and_googling">Testing: Spidering and googling</a>). See also <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Old,_Backup_and_Unreferenced_Files_(OWASP-CM-006)">Testing for Old, Backup and Unreferenced Files</a> which deals with the security issues related to "forgotten" files. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>File Upload</h3><br />Windows 8.3 legacy file handling can sometimes be used to defeat file upload filters <br />Usage Examples:<br /><br />file.phtml gets processed as PHP code<br /><br />FILE~1.PHT is served, but not processed by the PHP ISAPI handler<br /><br />shell.phPWND can be uploaded <br /><br />SHELL~1.PHP will be expanded and returned by the OS shell, then processed by the PHP ISAPI handler<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Gray Box testing</h3><br />Performing white box testing against file extensions handling amounts  to checking the configurations of web servers or application servers  taking part in the web application architecture, and verifying how they  are instructed to serve different file extensions. <br /><br /> If the web application relies on a load-balanced, heterogeneous  infrastructure, determine whether this may introduce different behavior. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />Vulnerability scanners, such as Nessus and Nikto check for the  existence of well-known web directories. They may allow the tester to  download the web site structure, which is helpful when trying to  determine the configuration of web directories and how individual file  extensions are served. Other tools that can be used for this purpose  include: <br />•  wget - <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget">http://www.gnu.org/software/wget</a><br />•  curl - <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">http://curl.haxx.se</a> <br />•  google for “web mirroring tools”.<br /></div></body></html>
