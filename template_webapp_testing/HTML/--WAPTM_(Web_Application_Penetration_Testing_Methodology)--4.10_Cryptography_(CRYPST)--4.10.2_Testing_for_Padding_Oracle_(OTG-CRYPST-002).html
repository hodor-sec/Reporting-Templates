The existence of a padding oracle allows an attacker  to decrypt encrypted data and encrypt arbitrary data without knowledge  of the key used for these cryptographic operations. This can lead to  leakage of sensible data or to privilege escalation vulnerabilities, if  integrity of the encrypted data is assumed by the application. <br /><br /> Block ciphers encrypt data only in blocks of certain sizes. Block sizes  used by common ciphers are 8 and 16 bytes. Data where the size doesn't  match a multiple of the block size of the used cipher has to be padded  in a specific manner so the decryptor is able to strip the padding. A  commonly used padding scheme is PKCS#7. It fills the remaining bytes  with the value of the padding length. <br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong>  <br />If the padding has the length of 5 bytes, the byte value 0x05 is repeated five times after the plain text.  <br />An error condition is present if the padding doesn't match the  syntax of the used padding scheme. A padding oracle is present if an  application leaks this specific padding error condition for encrypted  data provided by the client. This can happen by exposing exceptions  (e.g. BadPaddingException in Java) directly, by subtle differences in  the responses sent to the client or by another side-channel like timing  behavior. <br /><br /> Certain modes of operation of cryptography allow bit-flipping attacks,  where flipping of a bit in the cipher text causes that the bit is also  flipped in the plain text. Flipping a bit in the n-th block of CBC  encrypted data causes that the same bit in the (n+1)-th block is flipped  in the decrypted data. The n-th block of the decrypted cipher text is  garbaged by this manipulation. <br /><br /> The padding oracle attack enables an attacker to decrypt encrypted data  without knowledge of the encryption key and used cipher by sending  skillful manipulated cipher texts to the padding oracle and observing of  the results returned by it. This causes loss of confidentiality of the  encrypted data. E.g. in the case of session data stored on the client  side the attacker can gain information about the internal state and  structure of the application.  <br /><br /> A padding oracle attack also enables an attacker to encrypt arbitrary  plain texts without knowledge of the used key and cipher. If the  application assumes that integrity and authenticity of the decrypted  data is given, an attacker could be able to manipulate internal session  state and possibly gain higher privileges. <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br /><br /><h3>Black Box Testing</h3><br /><strong>Testing for padding oracle vulnerabilities:</strong> <br /> First the possible input points for padding oracles must be identified. Generally the following conditions must be met: <br />1.  The data is encrypted. Good candidates are values which appear to be random.<br />2.  A block cipher is used. The length of the decoded (Base64 is used often) cipher text is a multiple of common cipher block sizes like 8 or 16 bytes. Different cipher texts (e.g. gathered by different sessions or manipulation of session state) share a common divisor in the length.<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong>  <br />Dg6W8OiWMIdVokIDH15T/A== results after Base64 decoding in 0e 0e  96 f0 e8 96 30 87 55 a2 42 03 1f 5e 53 fc. This seems to be random and  16 byte long. <br /><br /> If such an input value candidate is identified, the behavior of the  application to bit-wise tampering of the encrypted value should be  verified. Normally this Base64 encoded value will include the  initialization vector (IV) prepended to the cipher text. Given a  plaintext <em>p</em> and a cipher with a block size <em>n</em>, the number of blocks will be <em>b = ceil( length(b) / n)</em>. The length of the encrypted string will be <em>y=(b+1)*n</em>  due to the initialization vector. To verify the presence of the oracle,  decode the string, flip the last bit of the second-to-last block <em>b-1</em> (the least significant bit of the byte at <em>y-n-1</em>), re-encode and send. Next, decode the original string, flip the last bit of the block <em>b-2</em> (the least significant bit of the byte at <em>y-2*n-1</em>), re-encode and send.  <br /><br /> If it is known that the encrypted string is a single block (the IV is  stored on the server or the application is using a bad practice  hardcoded IV), several bit flips must be performed in turn. An  alternative approach could be to prepend a random block, and flip bits  in order to make the last byte of the added block take all possible  values (0 to 255). <br /><br /> The tests and the base value should at least cause three different states while and after decryption: <br />•  Cipher text gets decrypted, resulting data is correct.<br />•  Cipher text gets decrypted, resulting data is garbled and causes some exception or error handling in the application logic.<br />•  Cipher text decryption fails due to padding errors.<br /><br /> Compare the responses carefully. Search especially for exceptions and  messages which state that something is wrong with the padding. If such  messages appear, the application contains a padding oracle. If the three  different states described above are observable implicitly (different  error messages, timing side-channels), there is a high probability that  there is a padding oracle present at this point. Try to perform the  padding oracle attack to ensure this. <br /><br /> <strong>Examples:</strong> <br />•  ASP.NET throws "System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Padding is invalid and cannot be removed." if padding of a decrypted cipher text is broken.<br />•  In Java a javax.crypto.BadPaddingException is thrown in this case.<br />•  Decryption errors or similar can be possible padding oracles.<br /><br /> <strong>Result Expected:</strong><br /> A secure implementation will check for integrity and cause only two  responses: ok and failed. There are no side channels which can be used  to determine internal error states. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Grey Box Testing</h3><br /><strong>Testing for padding oracle vulnerabilities:</strong> <br /> Verify that all places where encrypted data from the client, that should  only be known by the server, is decrypted. The following conditions  should be met by such code: <br />1.  The integrity of the cipher text should be verified by a secure mechanism, like HMAC or authenticated cipher operation modes like GCM or CCM.<br />2.  All error states while decryption and further processing are handled uniformly.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />•  Bletchley - <a href="https://code.blindspotsecurity.com/trac/bletchley">https://code.blindspotsecurity.com/trac/bletchley</a><br />•  PadBuster - <a href="https://github.com/GDSSecurity/PadBuster">https://github.com/GDSSecurity/PadBuster</a><br />•  Padding Oracle Exploitation Tool (POET) - <a href="http://netifera.com/research/">http://netifera.com/research/</a><br />•  Poracle - <a href="https://github.com/iagox86/Poracle">https://github.com/iagox86/Poracle</a><br />•  python-paddingoracle - <a href="https://github.com/mwielgoszewski/python-paddingoracle">https://github.com/mwielgoszewski/python-paddingoracle</a><br /><br /> <strong>Examples</strong><br /> <br />•  Visualization of the decryption process - <a href="http://erlend.oftedal.no/blog/poet/">http://erlend.oftedal.no/blog/poet/</a><br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>Whitepapers</strong><br /> <br />•  Wikipedia - Padding oracle attack - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack</a><br />•  Juliano Rizzo, Thai Duong, "Practical Padding Oracle Attacks" - <a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/woot10/tech/full_papers/Rizzo.pdf">http://www.usenix.org/event/woot10/tech/full_papers/Rizzo.pdf</a><br /></div></body></html>
