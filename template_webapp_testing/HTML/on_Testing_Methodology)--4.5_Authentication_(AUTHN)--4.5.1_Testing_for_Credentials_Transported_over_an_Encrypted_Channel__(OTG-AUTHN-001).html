The analysis focuses simply on  trying to understand if the data travels unencrypted from the web  browser to the server, or if the web application takes the appropriate  security measures using a protocol like HTTPS. The HTTPS protocol is  built on TLS/SSL to encrypt the data that is transmitted and to ensure  that user is being sent towards the desired site.  <br /><br /> Clearly, the fact that traffic is encrypted does not necessarily mean  that it's completely safe. The security also depends on the encryption  algorithm used and the robustness of the keys that the application is  using, but this particular topic will not be addressed in this section.  <br /><br /> For a more detailed discussion on testing the safety of TLS/SSL channels refer to the chapter <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_SSL/TSL_Ciphers,_Insufficient_Transport_Layer_Protection_(OWASP-EN-002)">Testing for Weak SSL/TLS</a>.  Here, the tester will just try to understand if the data that users put  in to web forms in order to log in to a web site, are transmitted using  secure protocols that protect them from an attacker.  <br /> <br /><br /> Nowadays, the most common example of this issue is the log in page of a  web application. The tester should verify that user's credentials are  transmitted via an encrypted channel. In order to log in to a web site,  the user usually has to fill a simple form that transmits the inserted  data to the web application with the POST method. What is less obvious  is that this data can be passed using the HTTP protocol, which transmits  the data in a non-secure, clear text form, or using the HTTPS protocol,  which encrypts the data during the transmission. To further complicate  things, there is the possibility that the site has the login page  accessible via HTTP (making us believe that the transmission is  insecure), but then it actually sends data via HTTPS. This test is done  to be sure that an attacker cannot retrieve sensitive information by  simply sniffing the network with a sniffer tool.  <br /><br /><h2>How to Test</h2><br /><br /><h3>Black Box testing</h3><br />In the following examples we will use WebScarab in order to capture  packet headers and to inspect them. You can use any web proxy that you  prefer. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Example 1: Sending data with POST method through HTTP</h3><br />Suppose that the login page presents a form with fields User, Pass,  and the Submit button to authenticate and give access to the  application. If we look at the headers of our request with WebScarab, we  can get something like this:<br /> <br />POST http://www.example.com/AuthenticationServlet HTTP/1.1<br />Host: www.example.com<br />User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404<br />Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml<br />Accept-Language: it-it,it;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3<br />Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate<br />Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7<br />Keep-Alive: 300<br />Connection: keep-alive<br />Referer: http://www.example.com/index.jsp<br />Cookie: JSESSIONID=LVrRRQQXgwyWpW7QMnS49vtW1yBdqn98CGlkP4jTvVCGdyPkmn3S!<br />Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br />Content-length: 64<br /><br />delegated_service=218&amp;User=test&amp;Pass=test&amp;Submit=SUBMIT<br /><br /> From this example the tester can understand that the POST request sends the data to the page <em>www.example.com/AuthenticationServlet</em>  using HTTP. Sothe data is transmitted without encryption and a  malicious user could intercept the username and password by simply  sniffing the network with a tool like Wireshark. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Example 2: Sending data with POST method through HTTPS</h3><br />Suppose that our web application uses the HTTPS protocol to encrypt  the data we are sending (or at least for transmitting sensitive data  like credentials). In this case, when logging on to the web application  the header of our POST request would be similar to the following: <br />POST https://www.example.com:443/cgi-bin/login.cgi HTTP/1.1<br />Host: www.example.com<br />User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404<br />Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html<br />Accept-Language: it-it,it;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3<br />Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate<br />Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7<br />Keep-Alive: 300<br />Connection: keep-alive<br />Referer: https://www.example.com/cgi-bin/login.cgi<br />Cookie: language=English; <br />Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br />Content-length: 50<br /><br />Command=Login&amp;User=test&amp;Pass=test<br /><br /> We can see that the request is addressed to <em>www.example.com:443/cgi-bin/login.cgi</em> using the HTTPS protocol.  This ensures that our credentials are sent using an encrypted channel  and that the credentials are not readable by a malicious user using a  sniffer. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Example 3: sending data with POST method via HTTPS on a page reachable via HTTP</h3><br />Now, imagine having a web page reachable via HTTP and that only data  sent from the authentication form are transmitted via HTTPS. This  situation occurs, for example, when we are on a portal of a big company  that offers various information and services that are publicly  available, without identification, but the site also has a private  section accessible from the home page when users log in. So when we try  to log in, the header of our request will look like the following  example: <br />POST http://www.example.com/homepage.do<br />Host: http://www.example.com/homepage.do<br />User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404<br />Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html<br />Accept-Language: it-it,it;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3<br />Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate<br />Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7<br />Keep-Alive: 300<br />Connection: keep-alive<br />Referer: http://www.example.com/homepage.do<br />Cookie: SERVTIMSESSIONID=s2JyLkvDJ9ZhX3yr5BJ3DFLkdphH0QNSJ3VQB6pLhjkW6F<br />Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br />Content-length: 45<br /><br />User=test&amp;Pass=test&amp;portal=ExamplePortal<br /><br /> We can see that our request is addressed to <em>www.example.com:443/login.do</em> using HTTPS. But if we have a look at the Referer-header (the page from which we came), it is <em>www.example.com/homepage.do</em> and is accessible via simple HTTP. Although we are sending data via HTTPS, this deployment can allow <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/">SSLStrip</a> attacks (a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man-in-the-middle</a> attack) <br /><br /><h3>Example 4: Sending data with GET method through HTTPS</h3><br />In this last example, suppose that the application transfers data  using the GET method. This method should never be used in a form that  transmits sensitive data such as username and password, because the data  is displayed in clear text in the URL and this causes a whole set of  security issues. For example, the URL that is requested is easily  available from the server logs or from your browser history, which makes  your sensitive data retrievable for unauthorized persons. So this  example is purely demonstrative, but, in reality, it is strongly  suggested to use the POST method instead.  <br />GET https://www.example.com/success.html?user=test&amp;pass=test HTTP/1.1<br />Host: www.example.com<br />User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404<br />Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html<br />Accept-Language: it-it,it;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3<br />Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate<br />Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7<br />Keep-Alive: 300<br />Connection: keep-alive<br />Referer: https://www.example.com/form.html<br />If-Modified-Since: Mon, 30 Jun 2008 07:55:11 GMT<br />If-None-Match: "43a01-5b-4868915f"<br /><br /> You can see that the data is transferred in clear text in the URL and  not in the body of the request as before. But we must consider that  SSL/TLS is a level 5 protocol, a lower level than HTTP, so the whole  HTTP packet is still encrypted making the URL unreadable to a malicious  user using a sniffer. Nevertheless as stated before, it is not a good  practice to use the GET method to send sensitive data to a web  application, because the information contained in the URL can be stored  in many locations such as proxy and web server logs. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Gray Box testing</h3><br />Speak with the developers of the web application and try to  understand if they are aware of the differences between HTTP and HTTPS  protocols and why they should use HTTPS for transmitting sensitive  information. Then, check with them if HTTPS is used in every sensitive  request, like those in log in pages, to prevent unauthorized users to  intercept the data. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />•  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project">WebScarab</a><br />•  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a><br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><strong>Whitepapers</strong><br /> <br />•  HTTP/1.1: Security Considerations - <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec15.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec15.html</a><br />•  <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/01/ssl-is-not-about-encryption.html">SSL is not about encryption</a><br /></div></body></html>
