In most system  implementations it is expected that at least two roles exist,  administrators and regular users. The first representing a role that  permits access to privileged and sensitive functionality and  information, the second representing a role that permits access to  regular business functionality and information. Well developed roles  should align with business processes which are supported by the  application.  <br />It is important to remember that cold, hard authorization isn't  the only way to manage access to system objects. In more trusted  environments where confidentiality is not critical, softer controls such  as application workflow and audit logging can support data integrity  requirements while not restricting user access to functionality or  creating complex role structures that are difficult to manage. Its  important to consider the Goldilocks principle when role engineering, in  that defining too few, broad roles (thereby exposing access to  functionality users don't require) is as bad as too many, tightly  tailored roles (thereby restricting access to functionality users do  require).  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Test objectives</h2><br />Validate the system roles defined within the application sufficiently  define and separate each system and business role to manage appropriate  access to system functionality and information.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>How to test</h2><br />Either with or without the help of the system developers or  administrators, develop an role versus permission matrix. The matrix  should enumerate all the roles that can be provisioned and explore the  permissions that are allowed to be applied to the objects including any  constraints. If a matrix is provided with the application it should be  validated by the tester, if it doesn't exist, the tester should generate  it and determine whether the matrix satisfies the desired access policy  for the application. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h3>Example 1</h3><br /><table class="table"><col/><col/><col/><col/><tr><th>click me</th><th>click me</th><th>click me</th><th>click me</th></tr><tr><td> ROLE </td><td> PERMISSION </td><td> OBJECT </td><td> CONSTRAINTS</td></tr><tr><td> Administrator </td><td> Read </td><td> Customer records </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Manager </td><td> Read </td><td> Customer records </td><td> Only records related to business unit</td></tr><tr><td> Staff </td><td> Read </td><td> Customer records </td><td> Only records associated with customers assigned by Manager</td></tr><tr><td> Customer </td><td> Read </td><td> Customer record </td><td> Only own record</td></tr></table><br />A real world example of role definitions can be found in the WordPress roles documentation <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities">[1]</a>. WordPress has six default roles ranging from Super Admin to a Subscriber. <br /><br /><h3>Example 2</h3><br />Login with admin permission and access pages that only for  administrator. Then, login as normal user and try to access those  administrator pages URL directly. <br />1. Login as administrator 2. Visit admin page. i.e. <a href="http://targetSite/Admin">http://targetSite/Admin</a> 3. Logout 4. Login as normal user 5. Visit the admin page URL directly. <a href="http://targetSite/Admin">http://targetSite/Admin</a> <br /><br /><h2>Tools</h2><br />While the most thorough and accurate approach to completing this test is to conduct it manually, spidering tools <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/HelpStartConceptsSpider">[2]</a>  are also useful. Log on with each role in turn and spider the  application (don't forget to exclude the logout link from the  spidering). <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>References</h2><br /><a href="https://www.bookdepository.co.uk/Role-Engineering-for-Enterprise-Security-Management-Edward-Coyne/9781596932180">Role Engineering for Enterprise Security Management, E Coyne &amp; J Davis, 2007</a> <br /><a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/rbac/standards.html">Role engineering and RBAC standards</a> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><h2>Remediation</h2><br />Remediation of the issues can take the following forms: <br />• Role Engineering<br />• Mapping of business roles to system roles<br />• Separation of Duties<br /></div></body></html>
