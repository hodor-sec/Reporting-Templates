# Reporting-Templates

Several reporting templates in various formats I use for several tasks. Includes a Cherrytree .CTB file and an example HTML output which Cherrytree produces.

Usage:
 - CTB: Open the tool with Cherrytree: https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/#downl
 - HTML: Open the "index.html" in a regular browser. When openend, left shows a navigational panel. Clicking on objects shows results on the right pane.
