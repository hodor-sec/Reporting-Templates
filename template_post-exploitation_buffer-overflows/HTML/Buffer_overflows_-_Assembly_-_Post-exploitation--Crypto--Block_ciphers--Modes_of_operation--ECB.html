<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">ECB</h1><br/>The simplest of the encryption modes is the <strong>Electronic Codebook</strong> (ECB) mode (named after conventional physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebook">codebooks</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#cite_note-10">[10]</a>). The message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.<br /><img src="images/80-1.png" alt="images/80-1.png" /><br /><img src="images/80-2.png" alt="images/80-2.png" /> <br />The disadvantage of this method is a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion">diffusion</a>. Because ECB encrypts identical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext">plaintext</a> blocks into identical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext">ciphertext</a>  blocks, it does not hide data patterns well. In some senses, it doesn't  provide serious message confidentiality, and it is not recommended for  use in cryptographic protocols at all.<br /><br />A striking example of the degree to which ECB can leave plaintext  data patterns in the ciphertext can be seen when ECB mode is used to  encrypt a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap_image">bitmap image</a> which uses large areas of uniform color. While the color of each individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel">pixel</a>  is encrypted, the overall image may still be discerned as the pattern  of identically colored pixels in the original remains in the encrypted  version.<br /><img src="images/80-3.png" alt="images/80-3.png" />Original image<img src="images/80-4.png" alt="images/80-4.png" />Encrypted using ECB mode<img src="images/80-5.png" alt="images/80-5.png" />Modes other than ECB result in pseudo-randomness<br /><br />The image on the right is how the image might appear encrypted with CBC, CTR or any of the other more secure modesâ€”indistinguishable from random noise. Note that the random appearance of the image on the right does not ensure that the image has been securely encrypted; many kinds of insecure encryption have been developed which would produce output just as "random-looking".</div></body></html>
