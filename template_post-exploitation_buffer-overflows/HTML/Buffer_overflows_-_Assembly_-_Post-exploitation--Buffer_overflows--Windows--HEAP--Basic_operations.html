When a chunk is accessed  at the freelist that is bigger than the requested allocation size, the  chunk will be split in half to meet the requested allocation size.<br /><br /> Suppose at freelist[0] this is a single chunk of size 2048 bytes. If the  requested allocation size is 1024 bytes (including the header), then  the chunk is split and the 1024 byte chunk size is put back into  freelist[0] whilst returning the newly allocated chunk of 1024 bytes to  the caller.<br /><br /><strong> Heap Coalescing:</strong><br /> Heap coalescing is the act of joining together two adjacent chunks of  heap memory that are free when the centre chunk is also freed.<br /><br /> The reason why the heap manager will do this is to perform effective use  of the segment memory. Of course, there is a trade off on efficiency  when chunks are freed. Heap coalescing is a very important operation  because multiple chunks can be added together (once free) and be used  for other allocations of a larger size later on. If this process didn't  happen, then wasted chunks would occur in the heap segment and would be  fragmented.<br /></div></body></html>
