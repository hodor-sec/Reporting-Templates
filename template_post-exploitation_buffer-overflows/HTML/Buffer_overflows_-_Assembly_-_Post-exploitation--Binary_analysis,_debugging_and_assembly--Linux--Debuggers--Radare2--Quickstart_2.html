<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Quickstart 2</h1><br/>Usually this is the workflow you would follow:<br /><br />  • Start up r2 by using: $ r2 ./hello_world<br />  • Run aa to “Analyze All”, or the newer aaa.<br />  • Enter V to enter “Visual Mode”. (Hint: You can use ? in Visual mode too)<br />  • To view the graph of a function hit V. If you don’t see a graph when you enter into graph mode, it usually means that you forgot to run the analysis (rarely it could be a bug in r2, in which case please do report).<br />  • Hit p to show the disassembly at the current location. Hit p again to go into debugger mode which shows all register states.<br />  • v to enter code analysis menu. This menu shows all the functions analysed. Selecting one and pressing g “seeks” to that function. So the first thing to do is seek to the main function. This will usually be shown as ‘main’ or ‘sym.main’. Normally you’ll want to begin analysing the binary from here.<br />  • In visual mode, if you want to run a r2 command, simple hit :. This brings up the same shell that you would have access to outside of the visual mode. All commands that work there work here too. To close the command line, just hit enter with a blank line.<br />  • use s &lt;fn_name&gt; (Example: s sym.main will take you to main directly) or s &lt;offset&gt;  to “seek” to locations. s- to undo seek, and s+ to redo seek. This allows you to traverse the binary efficiently. Tab completion is available to help you out here :)<br />  • After some analysis, you might want to rename functions, to do so use afn &lt;new_name&gt; [offset].<br />  • To rename local variables, use afvn [identifier] [new_name]. This is the same for function arguments, but use afan instead.<br />  • Once you have done some analysis, you will want to save your work so that you can return to it later, use Ps [name] to save it as a project. Please check out P? for other project related commands. Most of them are self-explanatory.<br />  • To load a project, use Po [name]. Alternatively, you could also do this while starting up r2 buy using the -P option. (Example: $ r2 -P [name])<br /><br /><h3>Additional:</h3><br />  • To show all strings in a the data section of a binary, try: iz.<br />  • To show all strings in the entire binary try: izz.<br />  • Want to search for a string ‘Foo’ in the binary? Simple, do: / Foo.<br />  • This will return something like: &gt; &lt;offset&gt; hit0_X "Foo". To quickly go to this location, s hit0_X. Again, tab-completion is available.<br />  • To help further with traversal, r2 offers vim style marks. To place a mark at an offset, use mK. Jump to a mark ‘K’ by using 'K (exactly how it works in vim!).<br />  • Don’t like a theme? Check out default themes using eco?. To select a theme run eco [name] .<br /><br /><h3>TODO</h3><br />  • o to seek.<br />  • u/U to undo/redo seek.<br />  • dr and d in general in visual mode.<br /></div></body></html>
