<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">CPU Registers</h1><br/><strong>Main x86 registers</strong><br /><br />EAX - Main register used in arithmetic calculations. Also known as accumulator, as it holds results <br />      of arithmetic operations and function return values.<br />EBX - The Base Register. Pointer to data in the DS segment.  Used to store the base address of the <br />      program.<br />ECX - The Counter register is often used to hold a value representing the number of times a process <br />      is to be repeated. Used for loop and string operations.<br />EDX - A general purpose registers. Also used for I/O operations. Helps extend EAX to 64-bits.<br />ESI - Source Index register. Pointer to data in the segment pointed to by the DS register.  Used as <br />      an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the address from where to read data.<br />EDI - Destination Index register. Pointer to data (or destination) in the segment pointed to by the <br />      ES register.  Used as an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the implied <br />      write address of all string operations.<br />EBP - Base Pointer. Pointer to data on the stack (in the SS segment).  It points to the bottom of the <br />      current stack frame. It is used to reference local variables.<br />ESP - Stack Pointer (in the SS segment). It points to the top of the current stack frame. It is used <br />      to reference local variables.<br />EIP - Instruction Pointer (holds the address of the next instruction to be executed)<br /><br /></div></body></html>
